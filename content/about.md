# About Me


There is no consistent theme to this one sided conversation. A mixed bag of family stuff, cycling activities, photos, poorly thought out opinions, reflective pondering, reactionary rants and righteous posturing. Interests come and go.

I don't write to perform; I write as a by-product of my own curiosity. The posts here are simply part of a personal journey, capturing thoughts and experiences as they unfold rather than polished tales of daring-do or any supposed wisdom.

My life is, for the most part, reassuringly mundane, and there is a contentment in that. Itâ€™s a foundation from which to explore the occasional quiet challenge, the kind found in reflection, self directed learning, and the hills and the hedgerows of winding country lanes.

Keeping a blog is a means for self-expression. Quality just happens to be incidental. It's a scrap book. A record of moments and thoughts I sometimes look back on, and which I have chosen to share. It's a point of connection despite the poor signal. I can't fathom why but it can feel quite rewarding. 

Thank you for visiting. I'm pleased you did.
