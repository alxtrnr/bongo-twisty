# About Me


There is no consistent theme to this one sided conversation. A mixed bag of family stuff, cycling activities, photos, poorly thought out opinions, reflective pondering, reactionary rants and righteous posturing. Interest's come and go. Competent, never adept. 

Posts from 2006 - 2020 are from the archived monaxle: blog, which was published using WordPress. One of those is a collection of weekly updates of my eldest's first year of life. The updates were copied over from HTML files of the first personal website I created in 2000, Cosgrove Capers. I built that with something called [Homestead](https://www.homestead.com/~site/Login/index.ffhtml). 

I struggle to find words which convey why I keep a blog. It's easier to come up with reasons why I would not. I'm not good at writing.  I don't tell a good story. There are few drama's or tales of daring do. I am not known for my humour or wit. 

Mediocre, average, and mundane are mostly fair descriptors. I have no angst about this. I have attributes which help make life relatively easy and safe. Neurotypicalish, white, male, able bodied, hetro and cis. There is contentment in the ordinary.

Keeping a blog is a means for self-expression. Quality just happens to be incidental. It's a scrap book. A record of moments and thoughts I sometimes look back on, and which I have chosen to share. It's a point of connection despite the poor signal. I can't fathom why but it can feel quite rewarding. 

Thank you for visiting. I'm pleased you did.
