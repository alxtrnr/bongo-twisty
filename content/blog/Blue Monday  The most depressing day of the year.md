How's your January 22nd? According to Dr. Cliff Arnall it's  blue Monday - the most depressing day of the year -

The Equation ‘Blue Monday’ is the worst day of the year according to a mathematical equation. The equation was first devised by Dr. Cliff Arnall, former lecturer at Cardiff University and founder of No Pills, a consultancy specialising in confidence, motivation and happiness. Blue Monday marks the start of the final full week in January when people experience a series of combined depressive effects. The mathematical equation is:

The model was broken down using 6 immediately identifiable factors; weather (W), debt (d), time since Christmas (T), time since failing our new year’s resolutions (Q), low motivational levels (M) and the feeling of a need to take action (Na).

The equation calculates that Monday 22nd January is officially the worst day of the year in 2007, when the Christmas glow has faded away, New Year’s resolutions have been broken, cold winter weather has set in and credit card bills will be landing on doormats across the land, whilst the January pay-check is still one week away.

Well it may be for some but for the last 38 years its been my birthday. This year like all others I've enjoyed the miserable cold wet weather and made the most of getting older. Don't let the buggers get you down.

Buck the trend, give the finger to the naysayers and put a smile on your face for the rest of the day.
