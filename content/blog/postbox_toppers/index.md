Riding about on my bike I often see Post Box Toppers. A distinctly British tradition.

<div class="gallery-grid">
  {{< glightbox-figure src="noah.jpg" title="Noah's Ark" alt="Knitted Noahâ€™s Ark scene on a post box. The decoration includes a knitted ark with black and white zebras, a chicken perched on top, two people in raincoats and boots, and a crocodile. The display sits in front of a brick wall and leafy trees." >}}
  {{< glightbox-figure src="ladies.jpg" title="Cosy Ladies" alt="Two large knitted dolls dressed in swimsuits sitting on a red post box, one in turquoise and one in red, holding picnic items. A sign beneath them reads The Cosy Ladies Picnic Time, Knitted by members and friends of Eastry WI. The dolls are plump and cheerful, with detailed clothing and accessories, and are set against a street and building background." >}}
  {{< glightbox-figure src="pirates.jpg" title="Pirates" alt="A pirate-themed knitted scene atop a red post box. The display features multiple pirates, a treasure chest, a shark, a palm tree, and a mermaid with pink hair, all crafted with yarn and arranged on a blue crocheted base, with houses and a traffic light in the background." >}}
  {{< glightbox-figure src="maypole.jpg" title="Maypole" alt="Colourful knitted figures of children dancing around a maypole on the top of a red post box. Each child holds a ribbon extending from the pole; the green base is decorated with large knitted flowers. The background shows rooftops and a cloudy sky." >}}

I think they're great. I imagine a lot of laughs go into their creation.
