I used to follow this route or variation thereof on workdays between November 2009 - November 2013. Back then I managed a children's home on the route. It was a tough job. Not so tough as what the children and young people went through prior to and most likely after leaving there.

We did our best to make it as good as we could. For many it was no more than an unwanted stop gap before going back to their chaotic families or onto their own chaotic young adulthood. Maybe some will one day look back and feel that they were with people that thought they were good enough simply in their being.
