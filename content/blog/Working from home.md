I don’t miss going into an office one bit. 

Though I have an office of sorts at home none of the office dynamics come with it. I don’t miss the office *systems* that are I understand there to help but are so often a hindrance. I don’t miss seeing a note above the kitchen sink reminding us of our responsibility to wash up our own cups. I don’t miss self important administrators who miss entirely the point they are there to help make things work. I don’t miss managers and their delusions of grandeur, acted out for any accommodating audience. 

I enjoyed the office banter though it’s a small loss for what for what I no longer endure.
