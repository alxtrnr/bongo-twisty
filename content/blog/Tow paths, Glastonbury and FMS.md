I had a free pass to the Glastonbury Festival. This came about by volunteering with Festival Medical Services. I worked a couple of eight-hour shifts but was otherwise free to do as I pleased. Seemed like a good opportunity too for another ride. I left home on Wednesday evening, rode through the night and was on-site late Thursday morning. The first shift was from midnight to 8.00 am.

It took a bit longer than I anticipated. Just under 16 hours in total. It was not the quickest of routes. I followed canal towpaths and riverside ways for most of the journey. The Grand Union Canal from West London to Slough. Jubilee River to Maidenhead. Thames Pathway to Reading. Kennet and Avon canal as far as Hungerford. That got a bit tiresome. Slow going and bumpy. I left the route just outside Hungerford and found my way along roads for the rest of the way.

I pitched up at around 11 am. It felt a bit surreal. No sleep and 180 miles on the bike is a great way to feel off your face without the need for psychoactive substances.  I enjoyed the attention garnered by my efforts, the novelty of meeting new people and being shown around the facilities.

The weekend went well. The shifts I worked were great. Festival Medical Services is a full-on provision. Everything from podiatry to dentistry with A&E and mental health provision between the two. In total over 5000 festival-goers were seen with only about 50 or so of them having to be conveyed offsite to local services. My role was mostly supporting people who had taken a few too many recreational drugs and were feeling a bit out of sorts. I worked with a good team and did my bit. 

On my time off I did as you do and walked around and took in all that I could. I did not plan anything so just wandered from one attraction to another. I was last there in the early nineties. It was less organised then and without the tight security. Hedonistic over-consumption seemed the same. Even the green field and healing field were verging on overdoing things. Ironic given the environmental credentials that are keenly espoused these days. David Attenborough even did a turn! 

I left on Sunday morning. Worked my second shift the night before. I did not feel inclined to stay any longer. As much as I enjoyed the experience and company along the way I was looking forward to the ride home as much as I wanted to get it done with.

I followed a stretch of the Kennet and Avon I missed on the way. From close to Bradford upon Avon to All Cannings. Glad I did but only really to see the spectacle of the Caen Hill Locks. The longest array of locks in the UK. Twenty six of them. One year a bloke nicked a boat and mistakenly found himself there. He gave up his escape after passing through two or three and then set the boat on fire!
