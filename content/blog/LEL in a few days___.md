Just a few days to go before the off. Bikes ready. I'm ready in my head. Ready enough in my legs. Route sheet printed. GPX files loaded. Working out on what needs to come with me and what I can put in my drop bags, one in Edinburgh and the second in Thirsk. These are times I am scheduled to pass through each control.

The plan is to stop for a sleep at Polkington and Moffat heading north and Barnard Castle and Spalding on the journey back south. 

Live tracking of riders progress from the LEL site. My rider ID is EE26 for anyone interested. If I can make it back by 10:39am on Friday I'll be happy.
