Thinking about working nights. I am a bit concerned about the impact they are having on my health and well being. It does not feel good to have my body clock go out of kilter in the way that working nights leads it to be. 

Sores / impetigo on my mouth and lip. Feeling tired. Trouble with staying asleep. Takes a long time to recover and get back to feeling normal. 

I am considering bringing it to an end. A shall have a conversation at work about it. To stay I need to not work nights. I shall see where that gets me. If I need to leave then other options will open up. Part time / bank work? Not too bad really. 

Thing is I like working there. The work is not bad. The pay is okay. Holidays and time off is good. I don't especially want to leave.

I am feeling this unease with looking for other options. When I resign myself to a course of action I feel more settled. When I start to wonder what if I feel unsettled. The ideal work place is not out there. At least it is not in the form I am accustomed to operating in.
