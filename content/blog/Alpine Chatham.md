Christmas is nearly over. New Years Eve tomorrow. Been out with the youngest today to look at some houses. The first is not far from where we live now. It has three bedrooms but with room to extend on the side. I think you could get an extra two rooms in up and down. And its detached. The walk to town from the house is marginally more taxing than it is now with a couple of extra hills / flights of steps to deal with.

The second was quite unusual. It is built on Chatham Hill alpine style over three floors. There are four bedrooms here and a study. Off road parking for two cars and space on the road outside. The garden is totally decking on levels. The views are over Chatham Hill down over Chatham.

Visited great grandpa in Faversham. It was his birthday. He's 92. First time he has seen both the boys - hope it's not the last!

(edit - went to look at the alpine lodge and had a look inside. Bit disappointed. The workmanship internally and externally was cheap and shoddy. The place has not been looked after well. Came on the market due to repossession. Have to forget about this one and move on. The estate agents are meeting all my expectations).
