I absolutely love this video. Very relatable. Inspires me to plan and get out on a long bike ride. A video made by Tristan Bogaard and Belén Castelló. In 2018 they cycled the Pamir Highway in Tajikistan. They asked cyclists they met on the route, why do you cycle? This is what they found out.

Why do I cycle? I love the outdoors, different weathers, the sensation of travelling under my own power, being in and seeing the land I am passing through. 

Why do you cycle?
