Some time back I got hold of some expired Kodak 35mm film via this thread on Flickr. I got round to putting a roll through a camera a couple of weeks ago and have just had the prints back. Nothing more than snapshots of the boys St Georges Day cubs parade through Rochester. I used one of the boy's old toy camera hence the Spy Gear and mask on them all. I like how they come out. I like quirky.

I added the pictures to a Flickr group set up for everyone who got some of the expired film to share what they got out of them. Looking through the pool today and I was struck by the global appeal of a camera and of taking pictures. Like mine most of the pictures in the pool are everday snapshots. In being just that they created for me a sense of something I shared in. I guess that was the Kodak moment.
