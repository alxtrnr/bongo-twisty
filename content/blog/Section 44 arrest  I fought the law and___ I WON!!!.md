Got a phone call today from Kent Police. Well I was at work and they spoke to my spouse. They were ringing to let me know that my complaint has been upheld. The only details I have right now is the phrase unlawful arrest and that that they want to say sorry.

The message was that they are keen to speak to me. That they will be writing to me with the details I asked for in my letter of complaint.

So how about that then ehh? Looks like a photographers rights have been upheld. I'm a happy snapper!

I'll post more details as I get them.
