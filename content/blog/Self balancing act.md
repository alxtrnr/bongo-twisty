Nowadays I work from home other than 1 or 2 days a month. My work rate is somewhat greater than what seems the norm. This is mostly down to using LLMs to get things done. I have been open about this. The use of LLMs has not yet widely been adopted within my workplace despite co-pilot being made available. I use that sometimes but find Claud via Perplexity much better for many of the tasks I'm given to do. This means I am often way ahead of where it's assumed I will be by my line managers. 

Slowing down for a few days during the week has made sense to enable collaboration. I'm okay with that. I think that it's only a matter of time before it becomes an expected norm to use LLM's to enhance productivity.  Good to be ahead of the game. I am making the most of the situation until that time goes. I wonder how long it will be before it does. 

Ofcom's [Online Nation](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/media-use-and-attitudes/online-habits/online-nation/) report indicates it could be a while. Online Nation is an annual publication which looks at what people in the UK do during their hours online. The report show sluggish AI adoption. More than half of over 18s in the survey had yet to use GenAI, with 38 percent declaring they were "not interested" and 35 percent saying they "did not need to."  Forty-three percent had used one for work.  Less than one in five (18 percent) trusted the output. The numbers are slightly different for the under-16s. Fifty-four percent said they had used an LLM, with more than half (53 percent) of those saying they had used it for schoolwork.  

What with the home working and having a friend over this evening I've barely stepped foot out the house all day.  Stayed in bed this morning until after six. All this meant no time left over to get out for a ride. Not a big deal but also not what I had intended. A failure to plan out my day properly rather than not having the time. It all seems to balance out.
