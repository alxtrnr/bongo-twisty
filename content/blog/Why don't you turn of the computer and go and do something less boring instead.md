Today I have spent perhaps 80% of my wakeful hours looking at a computer screen. Roughly half and half between work and recreation. I am posting this as I want to keep the momentum up though have little to say about anything other than what's been occupying my time in front of the screen. That seems to me a little odd.

I'm checking out and switching off. Tomorrow will be different.
