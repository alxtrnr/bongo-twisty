I took part in a cycling research study last year in April / May. It was led by Arthur Bossi who is a PHD student at the University of Kent. Arthur's research was investigating intra - subject variability in acute physiological responses to high intensity interval training sessions. Arthur was easy to get on with and a great coach. I enjoyed the experience. Everything I took part in was at the University of Kent, Centre of Excellence for Sports Science Research at Medway Park.

**Exhaustion**

**The Takeaway**

I have a reasonable baseline fitness with potential and ability to improve. By sticking with what I am doing I shall maintain this good enough level of fitness for the foreseeable future. Good enough will do. Improvement is a lot of hard work. 

Taking part in this cycling research was as hard as I was led to believe. Pushing myself to the limit in this way is not for me. Long distances cycling is a much more enjoyable route to exhaustion, at least in my book anyway. It was an interesting experience and fun to be involved but once is enough. I like being outside, exploring on my bike and riding at a comfortable pace. I shall leave training indoors and fast riding to the roadies and circuit racers. Hats off to you all.Â 

**An opportunity to get involved**

If you are one of those I have just described and getting fed up with the cold winter weather, live in or close to Kent and want to keep training at a high level you might enjoy taking part in Arthur's current research project.
