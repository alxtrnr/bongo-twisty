A quick one before I forget. A couple of funnies Elijah (son no.3) came out with the other day.

**Seagirls** - I was visualising how they may look for at least a few minutes.

**Square words** - takes the sting out of any bad language he may utter.

The last was a comment and a lovely illustration of how he understands things -

> *Daddy, can you take the glass off the television so I can get in?*

Is that our bad parenting being exposed? What's that you say?? They all **love** the TV!!!! It's their favourite thing not counting the internet and the Nintendo DS consoles ;)
