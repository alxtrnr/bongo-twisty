I spent a very pleasant Monday afternoon this week in the cushioning embrace of clinical morphine.  Not sleeping but not awake. Sedate euphoria just beneath the surface of consciousness in the most comfortable bed I've ever had the pleasure of lying in.

The experience did not come without a cost.  A bi lateral knee anthroscopy with a partial meniscecectomy. A cost well worth paying I'd say given the long term returns I'm hoping the investment will bring.

At least two weeks off work to recuperate at home. Spending time with my feet up and all the understanding in the world from spouse.  Things really are pretty good.
