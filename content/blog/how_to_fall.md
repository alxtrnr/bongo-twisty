At judo tonight with three of the boys tonight. It was their attendance. Inspired by WWE and trampolining in the back garden. The oldest is nominated by his brothers to demonstrate how to fall to the ground. With a shriek of exuberance he jumps high into the air, does a half turn and comes crashing to the floor on his back and winds himself. All that was missing was the trampoline. The instructor was a bit surprised.
