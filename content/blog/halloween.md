A couple more for the [collection](https://www.bongotwisty.blog/gallery/postbox_toppers/). Seasonal additions in October for the run up to Halloween. These two post boxes are at either end of Highham, a small village in Medway. The toppers are changed every now and then and sometimes swapped between the post boxes at one end with the other. I think the same person does them both. Whoever it is they're doing a great job. Skilled, community minded, with a great sense of humour and playfullness.
