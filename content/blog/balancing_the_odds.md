Out Wednesday evening on the bike. I was a little bit apprehensive about what might go wrong this time. After a recent spate of punctures, damaged GPS devices and mechanical failures I am happy to say the ride was uneventful. 

I did not go out yesterday. We had a late dinner after which I went to bed to watch a film - "[I Swear](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt31514146/)". Brilliant film. Both sad and inspiring. Loved it. Certainly put my bike troubles into perspective if needed. 

Up and out early this morning to get the miles in. Just a couple of kilometres from home I crossed a patch of black ice, tumbled off my bike and hit the ground. Fortunately no injuries other than a bit of a scrape to my right hip. The bike seems undamaged. My GPS and phone survived without a scratch on them. I thought the phone may have been damaged as it was in my pocket on the side I came down on the ground. 

I guess it's just one of those things that I can ride all year, cover over 10,000 miles without a mishap and then in the space of five weeks have a series of unfortunate events. Probabilities and factors stacking up I guess. I'll admit to thinking what's next while knowing if I identify and manage foreseeable risks the probability of anything else happening is no greater now than it ever was. It's kind of reassurring and enough to keep me going.
