I started using Mastodon again in January this year. Biggest bonus was finding a lot of people's online spaces and blogs. My RSS feed has been transformed.

Two main sources have guided my discovery of blogs to read. JC Probably's [Postroll](https://notes.jeddacp.com/postroll/)  and [Manu's](https://manuelmoreale.com) [People and Blogs](https://peopleandblogs.com/?ref=weekly-thing)

I felt inspired by the posts and sites I found. I've enjoyed setting up this current iteration of my own site and making a new home for a good number of posts I have written over the years. Adding to them once more every now and then. 

One of JC Probably's [posts](https://notes.jeddacp.com/blaugust-2025-round-2/) made reference to Blaugust. Blaugust is a grassroots IndieWeb initiative that recognises, promotes and encourages the act of keeping a personal blog. 

Sounded like a good fit for me right now. Another source of discovery and a pop up blogging gym.  Something that may help me to build and establish a blogging habit.

I was a few days late to the party. It goes on all month though so not a big deal. The frequency I've been writing new posts has predictably increased. Early days though. Habits can be slippery little bastards. You think you've got one established, routines change and all of a sudden that new 'habit' is neglected. I do find the prospect of having of posts to look back on just as appealing as I have ever done. Choosing to go with it until I don't anymore.
