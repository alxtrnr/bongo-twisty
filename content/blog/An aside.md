I got me some [Windfree](https://www.windfree.se/en/home) ear protectors. The noise of wind rushing past when I'm out [#cycling](https://mastodon.social/tags/cycling) is very tiresome. I shall find out if they're any good tomorrow. Got a 400km [#audax](https://mastodon.social/tags/audax) to get done. On the way to qualifying for [#PBP](https://mastodon.social/tags/pbp).

Also in the news is [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@monaxle) and [Diaspora](https://a.grumpy.world/stream) hence the tags and this aside to test out a cross posting plugin. It's been four years since it was last updated. Be good if it works. Never got the hang of being very social on social media. I get distracted by the means then typically lurk about from time to time for a distraction. I guess that's fairly normal.
