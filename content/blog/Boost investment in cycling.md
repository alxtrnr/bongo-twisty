> Will you tell the government you want more money for cycling? The UK government is currently preparing its first multi-year spending review since 2021. This is a rare opportunity to secure long term funding commitments for cycling, as it will set department budgets for the next few years. They want to hear what you think should be prioritised in the spending review. *[Cycling UK](w.cyclinguk.org/cycle-campaigning)*

The government wants more people cycling, but isn't backing it with enough money.

In 2020, they set an ambitious target: half of all town and city journeys should be walked or cycled by 2030. They also want to double cycling trips from 0.8 billion to 1.6 billion by 2025.

The money situation is messy. While they promised £3.8 billion for walking and cycling between 2021-2025, they actually cut funding by 75% in 2023. They've recently added back £100 million, but it's still not enough.

Here's why investing in cycling makes sense:

- A £2 billion yearly investment would return £38 billion in benefits
- Car costs eat up 20% of low-income households' money
- Physical inactivity costs the UK £7.4 billion in healthcare
- Air pollution causes up to 36,000 early deaths yearly, costing £20 billion
- Traffic jams cost the economy £30 billion annually

Right now, only 2% of transport money goes to walking and cycling, which explains why we have some of Europe's lowest cycling rates. Experts say we need to spend about £50 per person yearly on cycling and walking to hit these targets - that's about 10% of the transport budget.

**UPDATE 12/02/2025**

The [government’s announcement](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/almost-300-million-to-gear-up-new-walking-wheeling-and-cycling-schemes) of a £291 million funding package for walking, wheeling, and cycling schemes is a step in the right direction, but it falls short of the investment needed to truly change how we travel. While the plans to create 300 miles of new footpaths and cycle tracks, improve crossings, and provide Bikeability training for children are better than nothing, they barely scratch the surface of what’s required.

While progress is being made, it’s not enough. We need sustained and substantial investment—not just piecemeal funding—to create a future where walking and cycling are safe, accessible, and attractive options for everyone. Let’s keep pushing for more.
