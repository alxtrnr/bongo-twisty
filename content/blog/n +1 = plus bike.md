Cyclocross with tyres to suit has been my do everything solution on two wheels for the last seven years or so. Audax, touring, light trails and commute. Until now. This [review](http://bearbonesbikepacking.blogspot.com/2016/07/pinnacle-go-plus-ramin-first-look.html) of the Ramin 3 hooked me! It's the first time I've succumbed to +1 lust and have gone on to click the add to basket button!

No regrets to date. I've had a ton of fun on the Ramin. I'm enjoying learning a different style of riding. Discovering loads of trails around my area that I would not have gone out of the way to find on my Crux. No terrain has so far proved to be inaccessible though the wide bars do at times slow my progress through narrow gaps in trees and overgrown vegetation. I had planned on riding [LEL](https://londonedinburghlondon.com/) next year. Now considering changing my plans to have a go at the [Highlands 550](http://www.highlandtrail.net/).

Just a couple of niggles so far. I'm finding it impossible to get the seat post clamp tight enough to stop the post from ever so slowly descending over distance especially on bumpy trails. Should be able to sort that one out at the six-week service with Evans. The other one is punctures. Two so far in about 150 miles. Not a showstopper once I learned the knack of getting the tyres off and on. Inevitable I guess with the variety of ground covered and there being none of the puncture protection I've become used to. I guess the rubber is thin is keep the weight down.

There's no functional overlap with my cross bike. Together they cover just about anywhere I can think of going. I have no recent experience of mountain bikes. Here's the one I last owned.

Things have moved on a bit since then.  Never owned a fat bike so can't offer any comparison with them either. 

For now  I'm loving the plus bike and feel well pleased with my choice.
