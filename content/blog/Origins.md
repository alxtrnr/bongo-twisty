I'm probably missing the point a bit in that I'm spending miles more time playing around with widgets, links and profiles than I am in adding anything original to this blog.

Become a little bit distracted by the frills and fancy bits. Finding out how to make a blog and what you can do with it is at the moment providing all the fun.

Probably all of the sites that have inspired me to cultivate monaxle interneticity are linked to from my de.licio.us tags. Incidentally I am trying out ma.gnolia as a social bookmarking tool though not inclined to leave de.licio.us. I'm not keen on the presentation in ma.gnolia. I prefer the immediate functionality of de.licio.us

I have been inspired by my dads blog posts. His blog is linked to under the Family header. He's working on Flores Island, Indonesia for Voluntary Service Overseas. He's setting up computer systems for the island cooperatives and such like. His writing puts you right there. He is able to make a story out of everyday things and gives a great observational commentary. For someone so taciturn in person he is quite verbose online!

I have also been inspired to spend some time with this blog and learning more about web2 applications by my experience on Flickr and from a guy I came across there, [Thomas Hawk](https://thomashawk.com/). My thanks to both. In addition are the multitude of web services providing great web software for no more than donations and good karma!! The blog is hosted on jumpline. It came free for a year and is a pretty good service as far as I can tell so thought I'd try and make some use of it. Be glad to have any comment on anyone who knows about VDS technology.

Times are good and if your looking to find out more about all this you might find my links and tags useful.
