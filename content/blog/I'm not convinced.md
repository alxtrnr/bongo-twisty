Some things make little sense to me.Â  Here's a dozen of them -

1. Little electric cars for very obese people.
2. Homework for 5 year olds.
3. World financial markets based on rumour, nerves and speculation.
4. Allowing estate agents (*spits*) to dominate and shape the housing market.
5. The *war* against terror.
6. Royalty.
7. Having to hand-write essays  for timed exams.
8. The governments housing targets for SE England.
9. Having pernicious dross like Ed, Edd n' Eddie on kids TV.
10. The criminalisation of drugs.
11. Britain's big brother surveillance culture.
12. Anti Social Behaviour Orders
