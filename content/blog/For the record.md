Opened up the local rag and found they had chosen to print [this](https://listed.to/@alxtrnr/59668/tour-de-france-2007-medway) picture of mine to go with a story about the higher than planned for cost of having the race come to Medway.

I had submitted it soon after taking it with a few others I got. They published all that I gave them. This one and a couple of others twice already. Once in a regular edition and then again in a souvenir edition. I was pleased with that but am extra chuffed they've picked this one out again for publication some weeks after the event.
