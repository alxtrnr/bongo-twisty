I write and update policies and practice guidance. I work in adult social care. The language I use to write professionally must reflect contemporary thinking in this field. For some time now an emphasis has been on person centred, strengths based language.

The thought popped into my head the other day that the ten commandments are very much the opposite of this. Mostly shall nots. Mostly deficit based. All about behaving well to stay on the right side of a monotheistic god.\
Just for fun I thought I'd have a go at re-framing them. If I'm going to redraft others work this seemed like a good place to start. Take the most famous "Don't You Dare" list and turn it into an optimistic vision board dreamt up during a co-production workshop using post it notes while sipping on tea and munching biscuits.

I think of God as shorthand for whatever connects us. I also think truth comes more from agreement than absolutes. With these ideas and a person centred strengths based approach in mind here's what I came up with...

{{< divider >}}

**1. Think beyond yourself (You shall have no other gods before me)**\
When we're making decisions, we might think about what's good for everyone, not just ourselves. We're all connected. What helps the whole helps us too.

**2. Use words that build (You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain)**\
The words we use shape how people see themselves and what they think is possible. Language can open doors or close them.

**3. Value stillness (Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy)**\
Making time to stop and be quiet matters. It's how we stay connected to ourselves and everything else.

**4. Respect the web of humanity (Honour your father and your mother)**\
Every person we meet is part of the same fabric we're part of. We can treat people with the care and respect we'd want for ourselves.

**5. Defend all life (You shall not murder)**\
Standing up for living things makes a difference. Each life is unique and won't happen again in the exact same way.

**6. Be faithful (You shall not commit adultery)**\
Being there for the people in our lives builds trust, helps them feel safe, and enables growth.

**7. Share (You shall not steal)**\
There's enough if we share it. What we give usually finds its way back.

**8. Build understanding together (You shall not bear false witness against your neighbour)**\
Truth isn't something one person owns. It comes from conversation and shared experience. Listening matters as much as speaking.

**9. Be pleased when good things happen to others (You shall not covet your neighbour's wife)**\
Other people's success doesn't take away from ours. Their wins don't mean we're losing.

**10. Enough is plenty (You shall not covet your neighbour's goods)**\
Sometimes what we have is actually enough. We don't have to always be reaching for the next thing to prove we're doing alright.

So there you have it. The ten commandments for people who prefer 'might' over 'must not', from the perspective of someone who thinks there's an underlying current connecting everything rather than a singular godhead we must fear and obey.

Not sure about turning water in wine but we can turn stone tablets into a living document for feedback. I just need to get it through QA and the equality impact assessment process now.
