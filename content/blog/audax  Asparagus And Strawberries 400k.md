First big ride post Covid era. Started and finished at Manningtree.  Following a counter clockwise route on the map. The aim was to finish between 22 and 25 hours. Managed to in just under that. 21.5 hours. Very pleased.

It was the hottest day of the year so far. About 30c tops. A gentle northly on the way up to Wells gave us a welcome cooling breeze. I rode with four others. 

Cycling in a small group of similarly conditioned cyclists made a huge difference. Much easier to keep going and maintain a reasonable pace. Company is always good on a long ride, especially in the early hours before sunrise. 

Fitness and fortitude kept us all going. One puncture along the way, quickly mended,  just before the Reedham Chain Ferry. The hills at the end were humbling. I crawled up those at a snails pace. Made the final kilometer downhill to the end all the more welcome. 

Once finished I sat with the group for a bit of breakfast. My cognitive skills had reduced to a level where thinking and speaking had become a bit of a challenge. I said my thanks and farewells before making my way home. Thankfully got back safely having managed to stay awake in the car with energy drinks and caffeine chewing gum. 

Rides like this keep on giving for a good few days after. I get some great vibes thinking back on what I managed to achieve. A 400k bike ride! Let's have it!
