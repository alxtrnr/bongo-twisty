> Once we act, we forfeit the option of waiting until new information comes along. As a result, no-acting has value. The more uncertain the outcome, the greater may be the value of procrastination.
> **Bernstein (1998)**

I found that today reading a [paper](https://www.scribd.com/doc/63679278/STEEL-P-The-Nature-of-Procrastination-A-Meta-Analytic-and-Theoretical-Review-of-Quintessential-Self-Regulatory-Failure) about procrastination. What a great argument for doing nothing.
