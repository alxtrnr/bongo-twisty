There is a place on the tip of north west Scotland called [Cape Wrath](https://www.visitcapewrath.com/around-cape-wrath/). It's a remote wilderness that takes a fair bit of effort to get to.\
From the south the only way is to hike. The other way is via the tiny hamlet of Keoldale. Once there, between May and October,  and only when the tides and weather permit, there's a small passenger boat that can take you across the Kyle of Durness to and from Cape Wrath.\
From the slipway on the other side is a service road of around 11 miles to Cape Wrath lighthouse. It was built in 1828. It's in a bit of a sorry state.\
No one lives on the Cape other than a couple who rent some old buildings near the lighthouse and have opened a cafe there. The military use a chunk of the land for training, mostly in the spring and autumn.

I'd come to know of this place through reading about the [Cape Wrath Fellowship](https://www.cyclinguk.org/article/history-cape-wrath-fellowship). When it was established by Rex Coley in 1955 (under the name of the Rough Stuff Fellowship) the aim was to preserve the bicycle as a means for adventure and not just competition.\
To become a member of the Cape Wrath Membership all you need to do is ride a bike from the slip to the lighthouse. Collect some evidence of being there (a photo of your bike is enough nowadays), and submit that to the custodians of the Fellowship which is currently Cycling UK. 

Just the name of the place had me captivated. All it means is turning point but that took nothing of the romance and drama away.

I planned a route and committed to riding there from South Foreland lighthouse, atop the White Cliffs of Dover near St Margaret's Bay, Kent. It took me eight days to ride to Durness, the closest town to Keolvale. I camped there for a night before trying my luck with the ferry. Fortunately the weather and tides were both fine. I made the crossing. I was so happy to be over the water and was now able to ride the final 11 miles to the lighthouse.

With nothing more to do after pictures being taken, tea drunk and a bit of walk round I got on my bike and headed back. I decided to stay the night in Kearvaig Bothy. It's off the service road, down a small even rougher road towards a small beach. There was a few other cyclists there who I had met while waiting for the ferry also staying there the night.\
Woke up to clear and sunny skies. Rode back to the slipway, got on the boat and was ferried over to Keovale once more.

I had a bit more time than anticipated so spent the next few days riding over to Duncansby Head Lighthouse on the east coast. Stopped off at Dunnet Head and John O Groats on the way. I then headed west again to get a ferry from Scrabness to Stromness, Orkney. Rode around the island in a day then got a night ferry from Kirkwall down to Aberdeen. Caught a train from Aberdeen back to London and then a short ride home to Kent. 

It was an adventure. I think Rex Coley would have approved.
