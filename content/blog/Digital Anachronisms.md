I say I've phoned someone when I make a Teams call. I buy digital music and save it to my laptop. I sometimes listen to music with an mp3 player. I still use a digital camera. I guess that might seem old fashioned. Maybe using that term is old fashioned. I have no idea. To get to the point...

Maybe you are one of what I imagine is only a few people who have wondered how you can update the GPS assist data on your Panasonic FT5 digital camera since Panasonic [stopped supporting](https://av.jpn.support.panasonic.com/support/global/cs/dsc/download/gpsassist/index1.html) the download of this data.  Here's how... 

 [Update GPS data for the Panasonic FT5 camera.](http://control.d-imaging.sony.co.jp/GPS/assistme.dat)

Save the file as GPSDATA.DAT and copy to the SD-Card in the camera. I found this out [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Lumix/comments/nq2ul0/comment/jz2tito/?utm source=share&utm medium=web3x&utm name=web3xcss&utm term=1&utm content=share button). The validity period of GPS assist data is 30 days. To keep it up to date repeat the process every month.
