![A typical British back garden scene featuring a washing line strung between posts with various items of laundry hanging to dry. The garden has a neat lawn path, wooden fencing, established trees and shrubs, and what appears to be a small shed or garden building in the background.](washing_line.jpg "Washing Line")

The washing line. An essential utility. It took us ages to get the scaffold poles - about a year or so. In the end we got these two for a tenner from a fella taking down some scaffold at the end of our road.

Dig a couple of three foot holes. 5 bags of concrete in each. A few bits of ironmongery and other bits and pieces. Bobs your uncle and fannies your Aunt.

Washing line in situ just like I remember as a kid.
