JOIN: [Not A Crime](https://www.flickr.com/groups/iamnotaterrorist/).

> Group description : Police in the UK and abroad routinely invoke bogus anti-terror legislation to prevent photographers from carrying out their work, and photojournalists are constantly filmed at gatherings and their details kept on an ever-growing database.
> 
> The British Journal of Photography is beginning a campaign for photographers' rights, and we need your help.
> 
> There is no point petitioning governments, because they're not listening, and the problem is generally that laws are being misused, rather than drafted, to harass photographers. We need to raise awareness, so we have decided to launch a visual campaign.
> 
> Over the next year, we hope to gather thousands of self-portraits of photographers - professional and amateur - from around the world, each holding up a white card with the words: 'Not a crime' or 'I am not a terrorist.'
