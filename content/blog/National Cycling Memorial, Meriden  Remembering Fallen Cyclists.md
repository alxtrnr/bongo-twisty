I was in Meriden on Monday. The historic heart of England. Stopped of at some shops and came across this memorial to the cyclists who have died serving England in the wars. I had no idea about it before then. One of the few occasions this year where I have been away from home without my bike. Stupid decision. There were some lovely roads up there and the weather was perfect for a ride.
