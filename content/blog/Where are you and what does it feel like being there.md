The last post was 10 questions designed to encourage some thought and reflection on where I / you stand in life right now. I've given it some thought and here's where I am right now.

1) **How would you rate your HEALTH?** 
7/10. Getting better. Intermittent smoking and drinking - not a problem as far as I am concerned. Not exercising as much as I used to but still getting out regularly on my bike. I can tackle all the hills in Medway without getting off. Swimming with the kids. I can swim at least 20 metres underwater without a problem and a fast 50m on top any stroke you like without getting out of breath. Still enjoy diving and the 5 metre board remains a favourite. After having my knees done in September they no longer cause me a problem. All in all pretty good really.

2) **How would you rate your RELATIONSHIPS?**
a.) Significant other/ spouse/ kids? - 7/10. They all love me. I love them. We have our moments of intolerance but all wake up every morning being friends with one another.
b.) Your immediate family? - 7/10. We get on. I know they are there for me if ever I need them and I'm pretty sure they think that way to about me.
c.) Your friends? - 7/10. This varies perhaps more than the previous two. Some have dropped to the wayside whilst others have grown and flourished. Seems OK to me.

3) **How would you rate your JOB?**
a.) work/ job - 2/10. Rubbish. There is a lot of worth in what I do and I do it to the best of my ability. The problem is I'd rather be doing something else. Still don't know what though. Ho hum. I get bored and frustrated with pretty much anything I have to do. I like flitting from one thing to the other. I am making efforts to stop loathing my job and just get on with it.
b.) satisfaction of such? 0/10. It brings me no satisfaction at all.

4) **How are finances (assets and debt load)?** 
5/10. I live in conventional poverty. Enough to pay the bills, buy Christmas and birthday presents for the family and occasionally go out.

5) **How would you rate your "path" for your plans and goals?** 
The same. This one has always eluded me. I don't make plans and tend not to have goals. I'm a drifter I suppose. Perhaps I should give a bit more thought to making some. I know it makes sense. Seems strange why I have yet to get a handle on this aspect of my life.

6) **How would you rate your "Fun Meter"?**
a.) what you did in past 12 months? - 8/10. I don't like the phrase "fun meter". I enjoy what I do when I'm not having to work for a living. Does not take much for me to have fun. A bit of banter, freedom to go out on my bike, take pictures, go to the pub, listen to music, and use the computer / internet. The kids make me smile every day. Mrs monaxle keeps me amused.
b.) plans in next 12 months? - See answer for no.5
c.) are you "living life", or just going through the motions? - I'm living life and going through the motions. That seems OK to me.

7) **How are you progressing spiritually?**
Not really much at all. Getting worse. Be kind and love people. Why make things more complex than that?

8) **How are you progressing mentally?**
The same / getting worse. I think I may be getting complacent.

9) **Are your morals and ethics in check, getting better, or worse?** 
The same or perhaps getting better. I stick to my principles and will suffer for them if I have to.

10) **Overall and in general, would you say you are changing for the better, same, or worse?** 
I reckon changing for the better. Life seems simpler the older I get. Less angst and worry about what others think of me. I feel comfortable in my own skin. I'm a good person, I'm loyal and have people around me that I value and who value me. I'm grateful for that.

I'm glad I spent the time doing that. I feel pretty good! Things could be better but they could also be a lot worse. The areas that could do with some more thought are no surprise to me.  I  should make some plans and set some goals. It would be good if this time next year I can rate my feelings about work higher and have a bit more money to spare.

Surprises me that I have got to where I am now without any firm intention to do so! It's mildly amusing in some ways thinking that there are people in much the same position as me that have actually set out to get there. That's not meant to sound smug though I realise it may well seem so. I suppose it's not about where you are but rather more so about how you feel about being there.
