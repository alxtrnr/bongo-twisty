I was looking through some draft posts and came across the following lines. Can't remember writing them if indeed I did or what they were referring to. Reading them now has me thinking of  some group bike rides I've been on! Odd that because the rides have mostly been good as far as my conscience memory serves me. Maybe I was having an off day... 

Theme.

Incursion.

Nods. O hais.

Greetings. Not.

Click. Click. Click.

Mouthaching smiles.

Time for a distraction.

Enter violence on legs.

Awkward and misaligned.

Away with them. Superimposed.

Floating. Directional. Implicit. Rage.

*Friends* together.

Pool continues.

Broiling Rage.

On the edge.

Eyes down.

Mocks.
