I had planned to fast all day and go along to an evening meeting at the local [Bodhicharya Buddhist center](https://bodhicharya-kent.org). The apparent connect between the two was coincidental.\
The center opened in July. I'd been meaning to go along since then. I meditate most days. I've learned a bit about Buddhism over the years. I was curious.\
The fasting was prompted by a [blog post](https://prickly.oxhe.art/scarcity/) I'd read last week about scarcity. I'm not overweight. I'm just curious about fasting as well. The benefits I might feel. Whether I could make it a habit. 

Today started as planned. Up early and out for a 50k ride first thing to keep the evening free. During the day I [read about fasting](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/intermittent-fasting-guide#methods). I learned about the 5:2 method. The 16:8 method. The Eat:Stop:Eat method. Until now I just thought it was about not eating for a day or so.\
Turned out the method I was following was the last one. It's not that I chose it. It was the only way I thought of when deciding to have a go. The info I read said this was 'advanced' and should only be tried if you're pretty comfortable with the practice. I did it on Saturday for the first time without much difficulty. Go me!  

Got to 3.00 pm and all was good. Spouse came home with food. I'd not mentioned my fast. I kept quiet about it when she asked if I was going to eat. Let's do the 5:2 method I say to myself. It was only a samosa after all.

Back up stairs to work. Got caught up answering a query. Down at 6.00 pm. Dinner was in the oven. No problem. Today can be 16:8. This is what happens when I keep things to myself. Accountability is weak. 

I mention the visit to the Buddhist center while we were having dinner. All of a sudden I'm saying maybe I should just do the Zoom meeting this week. You know how it goes; one thing leads to another...

I do the washing up and watch the time tick by. It's too late to walk down to the center now now. I'm not going to drive. I conveniently forget I usually ride my bike everywhere. Looks like it's the Zoom meeting for me. 

I enter the meeting at the time advertised on the web site. I'm the first one there. I pass time listening to music and reading. After twenty minutes I'm still the only one there. One kind of non-duality I suppose.

With that I call it a day. I have been awake since 4.30 am. I go upstairs to write this [Blaugust](https://nerdgirlthoughts.game.blog/2025/08/03/blaugust2025-meet-the-mentors-blogroll/) post in bed. Spouse is already there. Cup of hot chocolate dear?
