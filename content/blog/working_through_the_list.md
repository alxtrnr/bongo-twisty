We are half way through Blaugust. I took some time yesterday to scan through the 146 blogs linked to on this [page](https://tagn.wordpress.com/2025/07/29/blaugust-2025-is-nearly-here/). So many to look at! 

As I made my way through the list a process of natural selection occurred. 

The ones I added to my RSS reader were in the main those that posted mostly about day to day life. Routines, activities, relationships, feelings. Reflections, opinions and understanding. Just one blog I saved focused on a specific area of interest. 

I did not add any blogs that - 

* served up a 404 page
* took more than several seconds to load. 
* had colours, backgrounds, images or font size that made it hard work for me to read
* were heavy on content I'm either not interested in or find out about through other means.  
* I could not quickly see how to find stuff
* only had a handful of few posts
* were heavy on meta blog posts
* had lots of graphics / artwork without any appeal to me

At the end of the session I had added 34 sites to my reader. The reasons I did or did not add a site says more about me and little if anything about the creator of the each. My site was not included on the list so I'm not going to make the cut of anyone else that follows a similar process.  

I revisited a few today and deleted a couple after reading more posts and deciding they were not for me. I plan to keep up with this process until the end of the month. I anticipate I'll end up with handful or so that I connect with and will keep coming back to.
