I'm really disappointed with my local MP Kelly Tolhurst. Kelly didn't speak out or represent me and her other constituents who will be penalised by the proposed cuts to tax credits.

Before the general election, Mr Cameron promised that he 'didn't want' to cut tax credits, and that tax credits 'were not going to fall'. I emailed Kelly to ask her to take a stand against these brutal cuts and keep her election promise. I'm saddened that she did not do so at the [opposition day debate](https://www.parliament.uk/business/news/news-by-year/2015/october/mps-debate-tax-credits-20-october-2015/) even though other Tories did.

As a father of four school age children my family and I will be hit hard by the cuts next year. We are, like millions of others, one of the "hard working" families living in the UK. If Kelly understood and cared about the hardships that these cuts will bring to my family and others like us she would have spoken up in the debate.

It's not too late for Kelly to do the right thing. I'm hoping she will remember her constituents - ordinary hard working people. Kelly is new to government. She is clearly keen on climbing the political career ladder going by her [voting record](https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/25430/kelly tolhurst/rochester and strood/votes). I'm keeping my fingers crossed she won't be calling out to Jack to pull it up behind her.

It was because of the many personal stories I read that I have worked actively with the Chancellor alongside Conservative colleagues to raise your very valid concerns. It was also for this reason why I have delayed my response to you until the Chancellor formally made his announcement today.*

It is still important that we continue towards our goal of a higher wage, lower tax and reduced welfare society.

Weasel words. Neither Kelly nor the chancellor can take any credit for the decision. Had the House of Lords not intervened the cuts would have gone ahead. Kelly's reply shows how this self serving politician will do an about face when it suits and seek reputation points from something she had no part in at best.
