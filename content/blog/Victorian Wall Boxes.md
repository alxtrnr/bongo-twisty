On a couple of rides I have been struck by the sight of these letter boxes from Victoria's reign. 

This one was very near Low Dinsdale, about 10km SE from Darlington

Wall boxes like these were introduced in 1857.  Pillar boxes were expensive to produce. A cheaper way of providing remote collection facilities was needed. The answer lay in providing a cast iron box that could be installed into an existing wall where such a location conveniently existed. 

Just across the road from the reservoir wall on Lake Vymwy.

Still in use 130 - 160 years after being installed. That's getting your money's worth!

**UPDATE:** Since noticing these, others have been catching my eye. Looking out for them now. Stopping to snap those I rarely see or seem unusual.
