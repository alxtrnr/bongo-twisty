Flicking through the interweb the other day I came across [Heather Champ's](http://www.hchamp.com/) blog. She's has a page there called [10 seconds](http://www.hchamp.com/10seconds/). It's filled with short video clips otherwise called 10 second long photographs. I love this idea. I am going to do some myself. This is the first. Regardless that it was taken a little while ago and is a bit more than ten seconds long it shall be the first of it's type for me. It's of Elijah on the seawall at Samphire Hoe.
