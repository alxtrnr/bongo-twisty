* Gather eight people in a room.
* Ask them to describe what a dog looks like.
* Let each person have their say.
* Now provide a description of a dog based on the descriptions provided.
* Try to get everyone to agree your description is the right one.

Though we did not discuss dogs we may as well have been. That dogs are different would have been dismissed are irrelevant.
