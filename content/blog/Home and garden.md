We have had a few bikes in our house for many years. Literally in our house. They occupy the room closest to the front door. The house is an early 19th century mid terrace. There is nowhere suitable to keep bikes out the front. There is a back alley leading to the rear garden. This has been obstructed since we moved in. It has been used as a place to dump stuff and had become wildly overgrown. 

The bikes being indoors has not been a problem. The room where  they are is used as a work space. Primarily by me. Our boys have each used it to for homework, playing on computers, storing scooters, football gear and whatever other stuff they have been into over the years. 

The youngest turns 16 at the end of this week. Two have moved out. Where they sleep when they come home is a bit of an imposition on the two at home. The bedrooms used to be shared are now single occupancy. Bunk beds went some time ago. Spare mattresses are dragged out, floor space is taken, clothes and bags are strewn all over. Not ideal. We need a guest room. 

To this end I have started to clear the back alley. Once that is cleared it will be possible to clear a big mound of dirt at the bottom of the garden. That's been there so long a few cherry trees have grown, matured and started to die back on it. When that is clear, I shall level the ground and prepare a base for a workshop / shed to go up. We will then have somewhere safe in the back garden that we can easily access to keep the bikes. The room in the house can then be done up and made nice. An office / guest room type of thing. That's the plan. 

Progress is being made. Close to 50 rubble sacks have been filled with spoil and deritus from the back alley and taken to the tip. Another 20 or so are in the car. I have a tip run to do this morning before work. I filled another dozen yesterday and have them lined up in the alley ready to go.

As I write, this all seems feasible. It's a big job. The weather being good has helped. A couple of friends have come round and spent time digging and clearing with me. There's a long way to go. If I stick with it I reckon we could have the room back and decorated by Christmas.
