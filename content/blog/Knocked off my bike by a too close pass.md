I was knocked off my bike on Bluebell Hill riding home from work at around 3:00 am. I was hit by the wing mirror of a passing Royal Mail DAF truck.

It was 3.00 am on Bluebell Hill.Despite next to no traffic, lights and bright clothing on, it was just a case of the driver not paying attention. I have no recollection of being hit. The driver stopped and phoned the emergency services.

I came round lying on the verge with a police officer in a white cap looking down at me asking if I was okay. Patchy memories of being attended to by paramedics - a line being put in my arm, head in a brace, bag and clothes cut from me. I felt really cold for a while. 

Taken to hospital. I remember the weighted blanket of morphine, the background chat of nurses and doctors. I had a CT scan, lay on a spine board for far too long. Nothing scary showed up on the scans. My head wounds were cleaned and stitched, and I was discharged. Had my work clothes in my bag. Got a taxi home. Wife and kids were away in Weston Super Mare.

The attending police looked after my bike, conveying it to Kent Police Tactical Operations in Aylesford for safekeeping. Collected it a day or two later. No damage done. My GPS was going the whole time - zoom in on the map to make out where I came off. From that point to the end, my bike was in a police vehicle, hence the max and average speed.

For a few days after I had ringing in my ears, dulled hearing, a sensitive and sore head. Got a bit woozy from time to time. Other than the head injuries and some bruising down my right side, no other damage done. The truck driver admitted liability. No charges were made as there were no witnesses.

Lucky to have survived. Seems I fell away from the truck. It was my wife's birthday. A gift of some sorts.

Time off the bike is extended by treatment and splints for bi lateral carpal tunnel syndrome brought on by and a lasting reminder of LEL. I could take the splints off and ride but have not done so in the last week. Bit of a write off on the mileage front this year. A couple of testing rides next [May](http://www.aukweb.net/events/detail/16-195/) and [June](http://tinat.cymru/saturday-rides/400km-br/) will get me back on the bike soon enough. Endurance and fitness comes and goes. Getting fit easier than staying fit perhaps.

**UPDATE** - I wasn't wearing a helmet - got compensation but would have received more if I had been (contributory negligence). [Should I have "covered up" to lessen the risk?](https://listed.to/@alxtrnr/59025/well-he-was-asking-for-it-wasn-t-he) Whatever, it paid for a new bathroom and kitchen.
