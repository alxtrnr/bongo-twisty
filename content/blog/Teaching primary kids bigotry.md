Another long day. Last one for this week. Hopefully be back to a more sedate pace tomorrow.

I had been intending to post some comments about the bigotry taking place in Chatham at the moment centered around a primary school of all places. I shall leave it till tomorrow. If I finish work in time I'll also see if I can get some shots to illustrate the foolishness that's occurring. Here's a [link](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/7016695.stm) to the BBC's coverage for a bit of background.
