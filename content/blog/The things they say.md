Kids are great. When someone commented to our oldest "*your getting very tall*" he replied with the all the innocence in the world "*and you are getting very fat*".

Some of his other utterances that make me smile -

**Sufferstrated** - what we all feel really when we're a bit frustrated

**Rhetsi McHarvey** - no idea where he got this but it's the long standing name of his imaginary friend.

**Collit** - the name he gave to a soft toy dog. It came about after we asked him (a fair few number of times) what he was going to *call it*.
