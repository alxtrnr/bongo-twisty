I take a lot of pictures and post them to Flickr. One of my contacts is a lady called [eshu](http://www.flickr.com/photos/eshu/ "eshu"). eshu is a social worker and lives in Boston, MA. From time to time we comment on one anothers pictures. eshu is always very complimentary of our boys.

eshu has recently folded 1000 paper cranes and sent them to over 58 countries around the world. [eshu's project](http://www.flickr.com/groups/thepapercraneproject/ "eshu's project"). All she asks from the people receiving the cranes is for them to take a [picture of their crane](http://www.flickr.com/groups/thepapercraneproject/pool/ "flickr cranes") and send it back to her. Her plan I think is to put together a piece from all the pictures returned. Should be something to see when she's done.

The idea to fold 1000 paper cranes originates from a story about [Sadako Sasaki](https://theelders.org/news/story-sadako-sasaki-and-hiroshima-peace-cranes), a young Japanese girl who never gave up. The story goes that her best friend told her of an ancient legend that said a wish is granted to anyone who folds a [1000 paper cranes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thousand origami cranes "1000 paper cranes"). Sadako had cancer which was caused when the atom bomb was dropped on Hiroshima in 1945. She wished for the gods to grant her wish that she may get well and run again. Some accounts say she folded all the cranes before dying and others say she folded nearly 400 hundred and her friends folded the rest after she died and buried them with her.

Today the paper crane has been adopted as a symbol of peace and people [send](http://www.city.hiroshima.jp/shimin/heiwa/crane.html "peace symbol") [their paper cranes](https://www.city.hiroshima.lg.jp/english/peace/1033408/1009685.html) to Hiroshima from all over the world. I'm not sure what [eshu](http://www.flickr.com/photos/eshu/ "eshu") is wishing for but trust that it will be something big and good. She's due to start an MA in social work this September so here's wishing her all the best with that.
