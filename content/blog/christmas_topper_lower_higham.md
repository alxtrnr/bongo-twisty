![A red pillar postbox at night is covered with a chunky grey knitted topper decorated with handmade festive crochet figures. On top sit a large penguin in a Santa hat and scarf, reindeer, Santas, snowmen, angels and other small Christmas characters, surrounded by knitted baubles and presents, while tiny red-and-white Christmas stocking decorations are stitched all around the edge.](20251209_christmas_lower_higham.jpg '{"title": "Christmas, Lower Higham,", "gallery": "/gallery/postbox_toppers"}')

I'd love to meet the person that does the postbox toppers in Higham. They all deserve a prize. Added to the [collection](https://www.bongotwisty.blog/gallery/postbox_toppers/).
