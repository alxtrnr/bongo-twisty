The end of [Blaugust](https://nerdgirlthoughts.game.blog/2025/07/25/blaugust-2025-calendar-weekly-prompts/) Week 3 has arrived. I'm going with one of the suggested prompt ideas for the weeks theme - Creator Appreciation. 

**Appreciating Bloggers**
* Lou Plummer at [Living Out Loud](https://louplummer.lol/blog/). Lou posted prolifically on Living Out Loud from March 2024 to June 2025. I think he's focusing on other things right now. I dip into the archive when I remember it's there. There's always [Amerpie](https://amerpie.lol) if I ever get to the end of that.
* Jedda at [Notes by JC Probably](https://notes.jeddacp.com). I really like the way Jedda organises and presents content. So easy to find my way round. 

Jedda and Lou both write with an easy natural tone. I've enjoyed reading everything they've shared. They both seem like good company and people I'd be happy to spend time with.  

I'm new to and currently taken by [Megan's writings](https://megancarnes.blog), [Matts Blog](https://mtwb.blog), [Muliama's Diaries](https://www.muliama.blog) and what Kris is sharing at [not all those who wander are lost](https://kavmac.com). I look out for and read everything new they publish. 

* [prickly oxheart](https://prickly.oxhe.art) - Came across this blog through the Bear Discovery Feed. The writing encourages me to stay curious and reflect on the everyday.  
* [Bear Discovery Feed](https://bearblog.dev/discover/) - Each time I look I find something good to read. 

There are others. The blogs I keep going back to are those with posts about the day to day, past activities, trials and tribulations, successes and failures, challenges and setbacks.

As an aside I'm using NewsBlur for my RSS reader. For the time being with a free account. This limits the number of sites I can follow to 64. My thinking is to curate rather than hoard.  I did a lot of that with Feedly and ended up not reading most of the feeds I collected with that.
