Spent a good amount of time today reviewing blog posts from the last ten years or so. It's been fun.\
Pictures and written words by our boys when they were little have been lovely to read and look at. 

I've re-published about 20 odd posts I made way back when. The passage of time adds something good, something more.\
I'm pleased to have these digital artifacts and keepsakes of what was.\
There is quite a lot more to go through. Slowly, slowly they will all be looked at and shared again.

I also dipped into some journal entries. Here's one from 13 years ago...

***Wednesday 6th February 2013***

*Rode to and from work and never got wet or muddy! Bike commuting is a solid habit.*

*Asked for and got brown bread sandwiches for buffet lunch at TCI training! In line with my intentions since the new year.*

*People at work breathing a sigh of relief and not getting battered and bruised by I and J! Listened to and acted on feedback. SM was in agreement with my advice yesterday!*

*Yay - This shit is working. Just started smiling having reflected on these things.*

I've kept some form of journal, diary or blog for many years. Some I have published. Most I've kept private. Often I write to help process thoughts and feelings. To vent. To expunge. I seldom review what I've written after writing it.

Doing so today was interesting, fun and reassuring. A reminder of different times and stages of life. Good times and difficult times. Some happy memories brought to mind. Good also to be reminded of periods of struggle and discontent. Negative thoughts and feelings seemed to be pervasive at times.

Looking back I can see that writing has quite often helped me to check my bearings and correct my course. 

Now feels like a good time to be. Things are working out mostly okay.
