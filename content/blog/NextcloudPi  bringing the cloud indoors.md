A follow-up to a post I wrote in November about taking back ownership of data from Google and the like.

I now have a running instance of [NextcloudPi ](https://nextcloudpi.com/)at home. A fully functioning, secure, backed up, connected and synced data server. The hardware amounts to a Raspberry Pi (3 Model B), an SD card and a couple of 1TB USB drives. A shoe box that would be at least twice the size needed to put it in.

Also got myself a new router (tp-link Archer C9)  as Virgin's Hub 3 does not have the administrative scope I needed to freely access the install on my local network.

I am now able to host, serve up and share my calendar, contacts and files without a third-party getting a look in. Photo gallery, media player, RSS reader are all rolled with it along with a heap of other apps on the side to install as needs must. The last thing I figured out was the need to set some port filtering. This was to have my DDNS accessible on the local network. Simple when you know how. Took a little while but I got there in the end. 

If starting again I would consider single board alternatives to the Raspberry Pi. Probably also consider external hard drives with their own power source. Not had any problems with access , transfer speeds or reliability. Perhaps no more than post install upgrade craving.     

Unlimited credits to Nacho Parker for leading the [NextcloudPi](https://github.com/nextcloud/nextcloudpi?tab=readme-ov-file) open source community project. Colour me as one who has had it made easier to gain control over my own data.
