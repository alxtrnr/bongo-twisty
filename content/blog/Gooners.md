Trip up to Arsenal's new Emirates stadium. I'm not into football at all but have a friend who works on site. The club have done a great job with the new development. The area used to be a tip. Literally - it was run by Islington Council.

The stadium is surrounded by open public space. A pedestrian link between Holloway with Highbury has been created. Its a good place to have a stroll.

Whilst I was around I walked over to the old ground to have a look. The guts have been ripped out of that and work is underway to start on the new flats and houses going up in the old ground.

Spouse and I first lived together just up from the old ground in Legard Road, nearly ten years ago now. Seems like a lot has happened in ten years. Happy to say for the good it seems both for Arsenal and us.
