The boiler has packed up. To be specific the central heating water pressure switch is knackered thus we have no heating. I've pulled a wire to bypass the switch so we have hot water but no heating.  I'm freezing. Sitting here writing this with my jacket and hat on. It's gonna be replaced next Friday.  Not the sort of thing you want to be without over Christmas week. I know there are lots of people worse of than us but we are all quite used to being cosy and warm...
