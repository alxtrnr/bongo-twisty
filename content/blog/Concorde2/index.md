We travelled down to Brighton on Sunday to listen to a couple of sounds at the Concorde 2. I have not been a big fan of the venue. Mostly down to horrible toilets, officious security teams and a couple of occasions when the entertainment was not as advertised. Happy to say things were better this time. The toilets had been refurbished, security was unobtrusive, and the sounds were just what we hoped for. 

Roots Garden from Brighton and Mission Sound System from Edinburgh were in session. Each had their own powerful and well tuned speaker boxes in full effect. Ear plugs were available free at the bar. You could dampen the volume but do nothing to tame the ground shaking frequencies punching through the air. It was an afternoon / evening event from 2.00 - 9.00 pm. There was a good size livly crowd of all ages.

The event details include timings, location at The Concorde 2 venue, ticket prices, and mention of plant-based Caribbean food."

I got some practice using my new camera. I recently bought a second hand Fuji Film XT-4 and a 35mm 1.4 AF lens to go with it. I think it's fair to say that at this juncture it's a lot more capable than I am. Creative control is very much a possibility once I learn what settings and techniques work best for the environment, the subject matter and my intentions. Out of a couple of hundred exposures less than 20 were any good at all. Under or over exposed and out of focus in the main. Lots were poorly composed. Others did not catch the mood or movement. One or two looked okay out the can, a few were almost worth the effort of pulling through Dark Table and/or DigiKam. I am hopeful though that I'll get better with familiarity and practice. Might even learn how to film a decent video one day.
