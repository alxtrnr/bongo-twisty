01/01/2015 to  21/10/2015

I reached a personal cycling milestone today. I passed my previous yearly high. 2013 ended with 8,939 miles completed. This mornings ride took me up to 8,950. A #RideEveryday and the goal to get in 10,000 miles before January 1st 2016 has got me there. I'm pretty pleased with the progress.
