I have a childhood memory of occasional walks with my parents and siblings to the the ["spring" at Harty Ferry](https://favershamlife.org/the-spring-at-harty-ferry/). I thought it was just great being encouraged to drink the water that flowed from the spigot, in my cupped hands.  

Technically it's not a spring at all. A true spring would be a natural emergence of groundwater. The "spring" at Harty Ferry is actually a flowing artesian well. The water is under natural pressure within underground rock. The pressure forces water up through the well pipe toward the surface. There's no pump involved. 

The water was originally tapped in the early 1900s. There was a period of time in 2019 when the flow from the spigot stopped. This was due to corrosion of the stand pipe at ground level.  The old pipe was replaced and the flow of water was restored.  

Every year the quality of the water is tested. It's never failed public health standards and is pure and safe for drinking. 

I have a good friend whose grandparents lived in Oare on the lane that leads to the well. He never knew of the well until I mentioned it to him. As less than an hours drive from where we both live we decided that one day we should visit it together. The fellowship of the spring. 

On Thursday of this week we met up in Oare and followed the lane to the well. I drunk the water from cupped hands once more. It brought back happy memories.

He wears a dark green hat, dark jacket, and dark trousers while seated on the stone structure surrounding the well. The well features a traditional design with weathered stone construction and a metal spigot from which water flows into a collection basin. Pink flowers have been placed decoratively on the wellhead, adding a cheerful touch to this important local landmark. Tall marsh grasses and vegetation surround the well, creating a natural setting typical of the Oare Marshes wildlife reserve. This artesian well, originally drilled in 1900 to a depth of 76 meters, provides mineral-filtered water from the same chalk aquifer that supplies Shepherd Neame brewery in Faversham. The well ceased flowing in late 2018 but was successfully restored in 2024 through funding from Swale Borough Council and repair work by Kent Wildlife Trust.](alexander_harty_ferry_artesian_well.jpg "The historic Harty Ferry artesian well")
