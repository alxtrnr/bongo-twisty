A heavy rain of copper coins falling from the sky. Mentioned this to my son (4 of 4) yesterday. He pondered how great it would be if we could have multiplayer dreams. A dream server. Being able to invite other people into our dreams. I was giving him a lift to football training. His team won their match today. He scored.

Out on the bike yesterday and today. The weather was grey, misty and damp on both days. It was not especially cold. I enjoy it all the same whatever the weather. Every ride gives me a feeling of accomplishment. I love seeing my surrounds. I want to stay fit. I enjoy being outside. Some of the reasons that gets me out on the bike most days.
