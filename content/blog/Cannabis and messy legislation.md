Class B / Class C who cares? I very much doubt many people who  smoke cannabis do. To be frank I don't give a damn.

In spite of the [report and recommendations](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/acmd-cannabis-classification-and-public-health-2008) made by  The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs to keep it a class C drug Jacqui Smith, though having enjoyed a toke in the past, thinks that the availability of more potent strains i.e.  [skunk](http://www.bbc.co.uk/insideout/content/articles/2008/09/23/south west skunk s14 w2 feature.shtml "BBC") justifies reclassifying it to a class B.

The reclassification did not go quite according to plan.  The intention was to empower police officers to issue a warning for a first-time offence of possession, a second offence and an £80 on-the-spot fine would be incurred,  and a third would lead to arrest. The fact that the proposed tariff of enforcement differs quite significantly from the penalties for other class B drugs is one thing. The joke however is that the police were albeit for a short time unable to impose the on the spot fine.

In December 2008 shortly before the reclassification on the 26th January the Ministry of Justice [withdrew](http://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2009-01-26b.249535.h) the parliamentary order that was to give the police power to issue the penalty notice for disorder (PND) required to impose the £80 fine. This hic-cup was resolved on the 26th. Two Lords considered a hastily prepared motion to add the offence of cannabis possession to the PND scheme that very evening. They both had a [some interesting things to say](http://www.theyworkforyou.com/lords/?id=2009-01-26a.82.3 "The Work For You") about the reclassification though despite some reservations agreed the motion.

Who care's? Well it's not likely to be any children or  "young people" that like a spliff. Anyone under 17 or those judged to be vulnerable  cannot be given a Cannabis Warning or a PND for possession of cannabis. Not sure what happens to them. A trip down the station if they're unlucky and a referral to the local young offenders scheme or mental health services perhaps? Here's a [link](https://www.met.police.uk/SysSiteAssets/foi-media/metropolitan-police/policies/deputy-commissioners-portfolio---policy-on-enforcement-of-cannabis-possession-as-a-class-b-controlled-drug) to the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) guidance on the subject if you're interested.

Seems a little bit redundent to me. After all is it not children and the vulnerable whom are considered most at risk from smoking cannabis? Yet here we have a law supposedly designed to combat the scourge of cannabis use that does not apply to them.

Seems like somethings messed with the minds of those behind this change in law. A few psychotropics might do them a bit of good.
