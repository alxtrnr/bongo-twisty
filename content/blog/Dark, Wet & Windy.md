November done. Made good progress towards getting 10,000 miles in for the year. With just December left I'm going to have to put in some regular miles to make it. 

Luckily I'm in a  phase of getting out for a ride on my bike every evening. Been a week or so now without missing a day. It's the way it is with habits. Ask James Clear he'll tell you. Once a routine is established it happens without much thought at all. Got my bike clothes sorted out so don't have to think about what I will wear. Bikes set up with dynamo lights and mudguards so the dark and wet weather is not something to worry about. Cleaned the bike the other day. Drive chain and cables are what need the most attention. That's all good now. Just a case of getting changed after dinner and out the door. I have a goto route of just under 50km which ticks another decision off nice an easy. All these things make the habit simple to keep up. None of this is new. Been at it like this on and off for years. 

I have a cycling friend who does the same long distance [audax](https://www.audax.uk) rides time and time again. That's not something I have gotten into. Couple of reasons. I like novelty. Once I've done one I feel no draw to do it again each time it comes round, if at all again. It takes a fair bit of time and effort to complete the really long ones. I like to invest that in riding routes that are new to me. The other reason is not starting something I may end up feeling compelled to keep going with. There is an exception. The [RRtY](https://www.audax.uk/results/rrty-roll-of-honour/) award. Completed my first one this year in September. I've kept going. I like the idea of getting the five and ten year award for that. The beauty with the RRtY is you can[ make up the routes yourself.](https://www.audax.uk/choose-a-ride/do-it-yourself-diy-events/) Variety is the spice of life and all that.
