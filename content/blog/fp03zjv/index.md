![A silver car is parked with its rear bumper pressed up against the front bumper of another light green car on the street, showing no visible damage. Both vehicles are wet from rain, with the silver car's number plate "FP03 ZJV" clearly visible.](fp03zjv.jpg)

Went out the other morning and found this moron up against against my motor.

No visible damage done to my car. Their back bumper has a dent the shape of my front bumper. Good.

What got me is that they actually left it as you see it. Either they never realised or just could not be bothered. Halfwits whatever the case.
