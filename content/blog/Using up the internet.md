Here's a few of the places I've been in the past couple of days. If I do any more of these you will quickly see I follow stories about climate change. It bothers me more than I want it to.

The pope has something to say about evolution and creationism. I've been reading a couple of skeptics blogs, [Respectful Insolence](https://www.respectfulinsolence.com/) and [Skeptico](https://skeptiko.com/), both of which are righteous in their scorn of all things [woo woo](https://culturacolectiva.com/en/lifestyle/woo-woo-what-does-it-mean/) hence why that story caught my eye.

The last link is Medway based and is not an environment story, [Dickens World](http://www.dickensworld.co.uk/) opens April 20th on the site of the old dockyards in Chatham. I'll be taking the boys along sometime during the summer for sure.
