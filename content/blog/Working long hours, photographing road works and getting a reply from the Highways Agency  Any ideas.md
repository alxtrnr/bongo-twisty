11 hour work day. Glad I have only a few of them a month. I'm knackered. No dinner break either. Did a good job though. Very thorough. Ohh, and I put in a claim for my [expenses](https://listed.to/@alxtrnr/59018/higher-education-bureaucracy-and-expenses).

Some time on the road. Remembered I've not had a reply back from the Highway Agency to my mail about photographing some road improvement works on the M2 motorway. Time to send another. Here's the mail I sent to them last week minus my details -

> *I am a keen photographer and am very interested in completing a photo assignment of road construction projects.*
> 
> *I am based in Kent and would like very much to cover the work currently being completed on the M2 near the Darenth interchange improvement works. I would of course if given permission abide by all the H&S rules in place and any other requirements laid down. I would if required submit all my work to the agency for screening and unrestricted use. I am not seeking any paid employment or such like. In essence I simply wish to make some great photographic images documenting road construction projects.*
> 
> *I am not aligned to any organisation and am solely interested in doing this for the purposes described.*
> 
> *If at all possible can someone contact me with regards to the likelihood of being allowed access permission to complete such a thing?. Thanks very much for considering my request. I very much hope for a response and would be most grateful if this message could be forwarded to the relevant department.*

If you have some suggestions as to how I should / could improve on that I'd be very happy to hear them. I'd also be pleased to have any other ideas on getting the attention of the Highways Agency or for that matter any in-roads (pun intended) to this sort of thing.
