We arrived at my mother in laws house in Gloucester just gone 10.30 am on Saturday. I set about taking her old TV off the wall pretty much straight away.

Wrestled a bit with removing a fitting beneath the TV. Threaded hex screws. Bit of head scratching and lateral thinking followed. Realised they did not need unscrewing to move the thing that was in the way. With that problem solved removing the TV from the wall was as simple as it should be.

The bracket was removed from the TV with the intention of fixing it to the new one. Turned out the position of the fixing holes in the back of the old set and on the bracket did not match the position of those on the new TV. A new one was needed. The wall bracket had to be removed and replaced.

I nipped out to Currys to buy a new bracket. Â£40 for a couple of bits of metal. Whatever. Life is too short to go hunting for something a few quid cheaper.  I knew the new bracket would fit as it was the same as the one the TV was attached to when it was in our house. Holes drilled, wall bracket attached and TV fitted. All good.

Channelling the cables out of sight took a little bit longer but I got there in the end. Tidied up, TV stations dialled in and demo completed.

What with the shopping trip and a break for lunch the twenty minute job was completed in just under four hours.  

With that done it was time to get out for a ride...
