It is saddening that there are people in my life of all ages who are oblivious to or in denial of their smart phone addiction. Fixated by the screen they are unavailable to those around them. The impact on relationships this addiction has should not be understated. The sense of connection you may get from your device is an illusion. Life is slowly passing you by as will one by one the people in it. Let it go and get a grip!
