After announcing [record profits](http://money.cnn.com/2007/02/01/news/companies/exxon/index.htm?eref=rss topstories) ExxonMobil seem a bit tight fisted in their offer to scientists and economists to undermine the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [fourth assessment report](https://www.ipcc.ch/reports/?rp=ar4) (IPCC).

In a [very cynical move](http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,,2004230,00.html) the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) which is an ExxonMobil-funded think tank has offered payment for papers ($10,000 each) that emphasise the shortcomings of a report. You'd think with profits of $75,000 a minute and what they have at stake they'd have dug a bit deeper than that!
