**Family**:\
s3 returned to university. Except he did not. With the car loaded we set off from Medway up the A2 to Greenwich where he completed the first year of a Sports and Physical Education degree. S3 mentions he is now on a different campus...

me: Where's that then? Set the sat nav.\
s3: The other side of the river. I'm not really sure. Close to West Hams ground.\
me: Oh really? That's what was the Olympic stadium.\
s3: Yeah. Some of the course takes place in the grounds.\
me: What the same course as you have been doing?\
s3: No. It's a different course.\
me: Alright. What course are you on now?\
s3: [Sports Coaching and Performance](https://www.uel.ac.uk/undergraduate/courses/bsc-hons-sports-coaching-performance-west-ham-united-foundation).\
me: Same university?\
s3: No - University of East London.\
me: So how long is that then? Will your first year at Greenwich count?\
s3: Not really sure. Couple of years I think then another for an MA.\
me: Okay. So you kept that a bit quiet.\
s3: Yeah, I didn't want to say anything until I knew for sure I'd been accepted.

And so it went on. It's a three year degree. S3 just couldn't bring himself to tell me. This is third degree he has started in as many years. Seems confident this is the one for him now. Does not seem phased by the debt building and the years passing. Hat's off to him for not succumbing to sunk costs. I'm really pleased for him. He's taking charge of his life and is sorting things out independently. 

Spouse's medical test results all came back okay. Nothing serious to deal with. Relief all round. 

**Work**:\
Cancelled meetings. Modified time lines. What was urgent no longer seems so urgent. No updates provided as to reasons and future plans. I don't care. So long as I get paid for my time they can use it as they wish. Questioning logic and rational is fruitless.  Helps in some ways to keep things in perspective. Nothing matters that much for long. 

**Cycling**:\
409k done. A [200k](https://www.bongotwisty.blog/ladders/) on Sunday. Second consecutive [RRtY](https://www.audax.uk/awards-pages/randonneur-round-the-year/) completed. I'm on track for 18,000km by the end of the year. Extended the [Eddington Number](https://www.bongotwisty.blog/eddington-number-a-cycling-statistics-app./) app I created in February with [multi goal functionality](https://github.com/alxtrnr/cycling-stats-cli) to keep on top of progress. Pretty pleased with how that came out. Vibe coding. AI-assisted engineering. AI slop. Call it what you like. It never took long and does exactly what I had in mind...

**Photography**:\
Not a lot really. A few pics on Sunday. A couple more [Postbox Toppers](https://www.bongotwisty.blog/gallery/postbox_toppers/) added to the collection. A quick snap of a cycling buddy. I forgot to change the drive mode from single to multi shot. No worries. It'll come in time.\
Spent a lot more time with creating short codes and html files to optimise images posted to this site. That's gone okay. I am getting a little bit muddled with the changes I have made and to what. A change log would have been a good idea. It would also be laborious. I shall manage without.

Plenty of unscrobbled listens from my SanDisc mp3 player during Sundays ride. De La Soul, Outkast, The Streets, Kate Bush, and a load of Drum and Bass and Jungle tunes from the nineties. 

**Screen time**:\
A new blog post everyday continues. No reason other than it pleases me to do so right now. Pretty sure I have published a handful of posts during the week from the archives. It's becoming a bit of a hobby again. Who knows how long it will last. Not me anyway.

Another good post from prickly oxheart - [Block Your Exits](https://prickly.oxhe.art/avoidance/) - a post on avoidance, distractions and just noticing the pull and being with it. All stuff I am familiar with and practice from time to time. Good to have these reminders dropping into NewsBlur every week.

Not really a blog (I can't find a feed anyway) despite the name - [Awakening Collective Blog](https://www.awakeningcollective.org/blog.html) - "*Everything You Need for Your Awakening Journey—All in One Place!*" Not sure about that but all the same I find it a worthwhile read to support my own practice. It's a new venture led by Dr. Tchiki Davis and comes of the back of her work with The Berkeley Well-Being Institute. 

**Other business**:
Another very near full week of intermittent fasting. I thought Sunday's ride would be a challenge. Turned out much better than I might have hoped for. I think after a few weeks of it my body is learning to adapt. I cycled 100k from 5am till 10am having last ate at around 7.00 pm the night before. I felt alright for it. I think my metabolism has learned to burn fat when no carbs / sugars are lacking. I had a couple of bananas at my sisters house before 10.30 so broke fast after 15 instead of 16 hours on that day. Nothing bad has come of this 16:8 intermittant fasting so I shall continue with it for the time being.
