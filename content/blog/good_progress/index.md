Happy to be ending this month on a good note.  

Sent the [damaged Karoo 3](https://www.bongotwisty.blog/cracked_screen/) back on Tuesday. A brand new boxed unit with all accessories included arrived on Saturday. Hammerhead gave me 50% off the RRP. The additional bracket, 1/4 turn mount and the lanyard was a bonus worth £52.00. Free P&P for the return and replacement. Pretty good service in my books. 

I bought a gel bumper case to help protect it and had this ready and waiting when it arrived. Screen protectors are in transit. All I need to be now is a bit more careful.

It's been a very good month on the mileage front...

![November 2025 cycling calendar showing distance and elevation gain for each ride. The calendar displays 21 rides totaling 2,011 kilometers with 18,874 meters of elevation gain over 3 days, 23 hours, and 10 minutes of moving time. Notable rides include a 403-kilometer ride with 3,311 meters of elevation on Saturday, November 1st, and a 607-kilometer ride with 4,380 meters of elevation on Saturday, November 8th. Most other rides averaged around 50 kilometers.

Yesterdays ride made my yearly Eddington number (km) a personal best since the year I first started logging my rides...

```bash
=== YEARLY EDDINGTON NUMBERS ===
2025: 62 *Highest*
2024: 58
2023: 48
2022: 48
2021: 49
2020: 48
2019: 56
2018: 48
2017: 49
2016: 61
2015: 58
2014: 56
2013: 51
2012: 28
```

I've achieved this on the way to beating my overall distance total for 2015. I made passing mention of setting that goal [here](https://www.bongotwisty.blog/2024-and-10000-miles-done/), in my first post for 2025. That goal seems within reach barring any mishaps in December. This is how things stand as of today... 


```bash
=== ANNUAL GOAL PROGRESS (2025) ===
Goal: 18,000 km
Current: 17,008.2 km (94.5% complete)
Year Progress: 91.5% elapsed
Days passed: 334 | Days remaining: 31
Status: 🚀 Ahead of pace by 3.0%

=== PACING TARGETS ===
To reach your goal, you need:
• Daily: 32.0 km/day
• Weekly: 224.0 km/week
• Monthly: 973.9 km/month

For a smaller niche interest group (you're on RWGPS, interested in the stats above, and okay about using Python scripts and CLI apps) I wrote about how they're generated in this [post](https://www.bongotwisty.blog/stats_cli/). The code for the [Cycling Stats CLI](https://github.com/alxtrnr/cycling-stats-cli) is on GitHub.
