Deviating from the cycling posts to book mark my oldest boy's growing recognition in D&B / Jungle circles. The boy's doing good...

>  Krave is a FIFTEEN year old Jungle producer from Kent. I stumbled across his [**soundcloud**](https://soundcloud.com/os-12) last year and was astounded at the tunes he was making. You could easily pass them for genuine 1994/5 produced sounds. Obviously the golden era has heavily influenced and lent to his productions but what I was hearing was absolute fire.

And here's an interview with the boy and Brian for Drum and Bass Arena | [Jungle Music â€“ Inspiration to the Masses](https://breakbeat.co.uk/interviews/jungle-music-inspiration-masses). I'm loving it. So pleased for him. He's on fire! Brings me right back to my raving days in the 90's.
