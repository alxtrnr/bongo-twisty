Sometimes all I can do is to simply tweak things when not inspired to think of something new. That was the case with tonight's ride.

I couldn't think of another route I wanted to ride whilst still fancying something different. Decided to go with it anyway but in the opposite direction than to what I usually go and with slightly different first few miles. It worked out well enough. Felt different whilst not losing any of the qualities I like about the route.
