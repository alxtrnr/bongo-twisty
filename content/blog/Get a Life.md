I could probably think of quite a bit to criticise a big motor company like GM however I think I would have let this one slide...

> GM became the subject of sharp criticism when The American Foundation for Suicide Prevention complained about the insensitivity of a commercial by the automaker that showed a factory robot leaping from a bridge after it was fired for a making a mistake.

In its carelessness, it portrays suicide as a viable option when someone fails or loses their job."
