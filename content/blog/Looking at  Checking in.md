Reading lots this week that has been infused with anger in a corner of the internet I have recently been frequenting . The inauguration of Donald Trump was I think a trigger. I am in no doubt the anger was motivated by wanting to address injustice and to help and protect others. Sadly that seemed compromised at times. 

I think the line between righteous and self righteous anger became blurred. Emotional outbursts. Personal attacks. Damaged relationships. Judgemental critique. Piling on. Ridicule. Intolerance. Othering prompted by othering. I don't know but it seemed that some people experienced increased stress levels and negative emotions. 

I found myself thinking about projection. A reminder to check in on myself when feeling irritated, annoyed, intolerant, dismissive. Remembering to ask myself what might I be projecting? What do I see in the other that I have disowned in myself. What is it that I may have repressed, suppressed, denied, rationlised or have otherwise not owned, allowed and integrated. I get to practice this most days. Feeling angry and intolerant is an indicator that there may be something I would do well to explore in myself. 

I have no idea whether that applies to anyone that got caught up in this weeks discord. I support everyone that takes a stand against prejudice, discrimination and oppression. I'm grateful for the opportunities I have that allow me to reflect and respond rather than needing to react. I get that not everyone does.
