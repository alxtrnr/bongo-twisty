With the sizeable coverage there has been following publication of the recent IPCC report on climate change its easy to become something of an armchair expert on the subject. It seems good to consider counter arguments if nothing more than to dismiss them. A previous post linked to articles of this kind gathered together by a group in New Zealand. I've since found Canada Free Press also provides a [tidy summary](https://canadafreepress.com/2007/cover031307.htm) of at least some of the dissenting voices out there. 

At first glance I'm reading irate opinion and dismissive, unsubstantiated comment though there is a lot to get through before I'm finished.
