When I shut down my laptop on Christmas Eve I had a working internet connection (wired and wireless). When I next switched it on it didn't. Nada. Zilch. Kaput!

Windows 10 troubleshooter told me that the "Windows Sockets Registry Entries Required For Network Connectivity Are Missing". Worked through a few different '[solutions](http://www.kapilarya.com/windows-sockets-registry-entries-required-for-network-connectivity-is-missing)' others had tried and/or found to this problem. I was no better off for it. Still no internet.

For some time I'd been thinking about switching to Linux. This was the tipping point. Backed up everything that needed it and wiped all traces of Windows from my machine.Â  Now on Linux and so far so good. No data lost, free from Mr Gates and feeling the love of the open source community. Should have made the jump years ago.
