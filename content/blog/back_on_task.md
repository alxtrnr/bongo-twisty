No more than checking in with myself. A personal reminder about doing the most important things first.\
The last couple of days I have neglected doing those things. Tomorrow will be different. I shall start as I mean to go on. Notice the urge to drift, which will surely come upon me. Notice thoughts. Allow feelings. They will come and go of their own accord. I will choose to stay on task. To be in charge of myself. Do the work.\
I am committing now to a follow up post and reporting back to myself on this tomorrow.

In other news I have spent a shit load of time fannying about with python scripts, images and gallery [pages](https://www.bongotwisty.blog/gallery/). Got a lot done and learned something new. Bit indulgent with the time though.
