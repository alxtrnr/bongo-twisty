Busy day today. S3 football training taxi this morning. S2 back to university taxi this afternoon. Aldi big shop after that. Got a ride in this evening. 50k. 

Really wanted to get in a 200k this weekend. Just need this months ride to complete my 2nd consecutive RRtY. Can't ride a long one next weekend. Spouse is working so can't stand in on the football duties. Weekend after that is the last one of the month. Who know's what could happen and don't want to risk not getting the ride done. 

I know the weather is gonna be a bit shit but fuck it! I've just submitted my entry and will ride a 200 tomorrow. It's a route I have done a few times before. Stops are planned in at my sisters in Deal and Faversham and my parents place in Tankerton. Should be alright. Fingers crossed.
