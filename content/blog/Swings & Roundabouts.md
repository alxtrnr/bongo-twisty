Wife and boys back home. Much better with them around. Looking forward to Christmas. Two five minute stories - Great Aunt Flora Comes to Visit and a story about a bear that had been grumpy through lack of sleep. Been messing with a web hosting, a home page and a picture gallery thing. Should really have been doing something in connection with what Iâ€™m paid for. I justify this by knowing that last weekend was spent completing the inspection record for my final big job with the current establishment.
