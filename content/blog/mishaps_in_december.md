In my last post I noted, *"That goal seems within reach barring any mishaps in December."*.  Not typically superstitious but as I wrote that the thought of tempting fate did cross my mind. So it came to pass.

Out on my bike yesterday morning. First ride in December. It was going so well. New cables fitted. Inner and outer for the front and rear mech. Changing up and down smoothly. Responsive and powerful brakes. New chain and cassette. It felt like riding a new bike. Lovely. 

Just over 26km at the start of a descent in I change up into the big ring at the front and down a couple of gears at the back. Straight after doing so the pedals resist movement and the ominous sound of the rear mech breaking spokes in the back wheel sound out. I brake and come to a stop. The jockey wheel cage was detached and hanging mid way round the chain. Half a dozen spokes were snapped. The back tyre was flat. It was 0610hrs. 

I had a long walk home. Just over 11 miles. I am not a fan of walking. It was not too bad though. The weather was dry. The sun came out. The time passed quickly. I was not worried about checking in late for work. I have very understanding managers. Instead of going home I walked with the bike straight round to Matt who runs a bike shop from his garage at home. Matt had done the work on my bike the previous day. 

I was not looking to place blame. I just wanted to get my bike sorted and back on the road. Matt was as perplexed as I was about what might have caused the failure. I don't think it was the limit screw. When I came to a stop the chain was on the second biggest sprocket on the cassette indicating the mech still had room to travel. I'd not adjusted it and neither had Matt. Matt had no other bikes to work on that day so he got straight to working on mine. 

Got a call from Matt this morning. All fixed. Three of the broken spokes had gone through the rim tape which was why the tyre was flat. Spokes replaced, wheel trued, new mech fitted, inner tube replaced.  No charge for labour. Matt said he felt bad about what happened.  He told me he'd not taken it out for a test ride before handing it back to me the previous day.  He did tell me this when I collected it. Matt said it all worked fine in the stand but to bring it back if there were any problems. I certainly do not blame him. We both think that the rear mech simply busted apart. How that might have happened is not clear to either of us. Definite signs of wear and rust on inner components which could now be seen but none which could have been inspected or serviced prior to the catastrophic failure. Nothing that either of us have known to happen before.

I've had a series of adverse incidents with this bike over the last few weeks. I've managed to crack the screen on two different GPS devices, had three (now four) punctures on consecutive rides, now this latest mishap. I have a second bike but did not go out on that this morning in fear of what might happen next. I know it's not rational to think like that but still. I shall go out this evening and continue towards 18k for the year. Fingers crossed all will go well.
