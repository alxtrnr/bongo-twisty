Well it was one way to spend a couple of hours this afternoon. I followed this [tutorial](https://www.photoshoptutorials.ws/photoshop-tutorials/drawing/smoke-portrait/).

![An artistic smoke photograph featuring the silhouette of a human face in left profile against a black background. The figure appears to be emitting colorful smoke that flows dramatically from left to right across the frame. The smoke transitions through a spectrum of colors—starting with warm orange tones near the face, flowing through vivid magenta and purple in the center, and dispersing into yellow-green hues on the right side. The smoke creates intricate, wispy patterns with delicate tendrils that break into stars and particles at the edges, creating a striking ethereal effect."](20110529_smoking_elijah.jpg)
