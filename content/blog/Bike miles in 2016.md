Bit less than I set out to achieve. Just over a 1000 short of the 10,000 miles I had in mind. I fizzled out in November and never got back on it. Probably could have hit 500,000 ft of climbing with a bit more focus.

Starting again. #rideeveryday2017 According to [Strava statistics](http://blog.strava.com/2016-stats/) just 40 people logged an activity every day of 2016. Thought it would be more. Think I'll have another go at it this year.
