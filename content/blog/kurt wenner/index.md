I saw [this picture](http://monaxle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/_44859700_458e20f2-eafb-4d17-b4a1-14ba0134958c.jpg "BBC") on the BBC Week in Pictures feature for the 19th - 25th July 2008. I had to see more and a quick search was well rewarded. The links below will take you to the [street paintings](http://www.kurtwenner.com/street.htm "Kurt Wenner - Street Painting") of [Kurt Wenner](http://www.kurtwenner.com/artist.htm "Kurt Wenner").
