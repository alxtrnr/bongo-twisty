With a bit of a push through December I passed 10,000 miles for the year. Well pleased. At the start of 2024 I'd set out to cover 10,000 km. I reached that in August so stretched the goal to miles. It was far from certain pretty much from then until the end of the year.  No riding during the first two weeks of September due to symptoms associated with Covid.  Got back out though and continued to ride regular 40 - 50 km loops with one or more rides a month of a least 200km. On my second year of [RRtY](https://www.audax.uk/awards-pages/randonneur-round-the-year/rrty-faq/).

This is the most distance I've covered in a single year since 2015 when I got in just over 18,000km. Ten years on seems like a good time to work on beating that. 

I have a dream of riding to New Zealand (to visit my brother) and back again via the Americas when I retire. That's the direction I'm heading. Like the yearly miles nothing is certain but come what may the journey towards this dream feels worthwhile and fun. Long may that last.
