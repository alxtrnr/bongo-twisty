Off to Gloucester today to see the mother in law. She's getting old and frail. Spouse often goes to visit. She came back from one such visit a week or so ago with a new TV. Her mum had bought it as the picture on her one was a bit dodgy. She'd thought it would be installed when it was delivered along with a fridge freezer she'd also purchased. The fridge freezer was installed. The TV was not. Some misunderstanding, oversight or mix-up. Phone calls to sort it out did not. The delivery guys left and the TV remained in it's packaging. A frustrated mother in law told spouse to take it away with her. 

I installed it in our living room. A good upgrade on our one which was about 10 - 12 years old, smaller and without any of today's 'smart' features. Very nice to. A clearance discount for £160. All the same I felt a bit cheeky benefiting from mother in laws frustration albeit most likely avoidable. 

I received a Curry's £50 gift voucher this week in connection with a sim contract I took out in April. I put it towards buying another TV this week. An incremental upgrade on the donated one. With a discount and the gift card I paid no more than £200. Swapped them over last night. 

Today I will fit mother in laws TV. 20 minutes work at the most. Plus a 240 mile round trip, petrol money and weekend away from home. One good deed deserves another and all that. Funny how I'm now close on £300 lighter in my pocket.

Some compensation is having a bit of time when I'm up there to get a couple of rides in. A 50k today and a 200k tomorrow. I'm looking forward to having a pedal about in the west country.
