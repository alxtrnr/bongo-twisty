Here's a picture Otis (son no.2) did in after school club today. Well he started it off there and finished it at home with a bit of help from his lazy dad.

After he'd coloured in all the stars and what not he wanted to colour in the background black. That's what he wanted me to do. Not wanting to disappoint and keen to encourage I couldn't turn him down.

The thought of laboriously scratching away with a pencil for an unsatisfactory finish was enough to get me thinking.

Scanned the the thing in to the computer and used my favourite photo editing software to paint in the black. Bish bosh job done in seconds. Quickly print the picture out. Much better result than the pencil option. 

Otis was pleased - "*that's just how I wanted it*". The boy has vision!
