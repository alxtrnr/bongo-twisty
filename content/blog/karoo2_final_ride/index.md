It came off again on this mornings ride. My fault. I was still using the crappy ill fitting aftermarket bracket. I'd bodged it a bit to make it hold on tighter. That worked for the last week. It did not work this morning. The Karoo bounced out as I was going down a bumpy lane. Noticed straight away this time. Stopped and retrieved it. The screen would no longer display. It saved the ride till that point though and synced it when I got home. Tracked the rest of the ride on my phone. Joined the two together on RWGPS and voila! My ride was recorded.

The route, marked in red on an OpenStreetMap base, starts and finishes near Rochester, looping through areas including Higham, Cliffe Woods, Cooling, Hoo St Werburgh, Chattenden, Upnor, Gillingham, and Strood. The ride shows 527 meters of elevation gain over a moving time of 2 hours 26 minutes. An elevation profile graph below the map displays relatively flat terrain with gradual undulations throughout the route, alongside a speed/power graph showing variations in cycling intensity.](card.png "The Final Ride | Karoo 2")

I ordered a new Karoo 3 yesterday. £135 discount with Hammerheads upgrade program. I shall use the Karoo mount. Fingers crossed I shall get it by Friday. I have a 600k planned for Saturday/Sunday.
