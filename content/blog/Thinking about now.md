Trump. Not discounting the fact I perceive things through a filter bubble of my own making, it seems to me it's common knowledge the man is vile, mean spirited, greedy, bullying (add whatever nasty characteristic you like here) person. All that aside I found it funny to read this morning that he'd signed an executive order to reverse a ban on the use of plastic straws. I guess he must have been at a loose end and was looking for anything he could practice his signature on. 

My job. I really like the job I have got right now. The conditions are great. It's fairly interesting. It does no harm and may actually bring about positive change. I would do well to act in a way that does not create the risk of losing what I have.  Check in on myself when I catch myself slacking. Exercise a bit of self control when looking for a distraction. 

Cycling. It's been a couple of days since my last ride. Missing another day is misaligned with the heading I want to be on. I shall go out for a ride tonight. 

Billionaires. Reading a lot of hate towards billionaires. They're billionaires for all sorts of reasons, one of which is lots of lots of people individually choosing to use the services they provide. I think if everyone decided on an individual basis not to use those services that would be a step in the right direction towards meaningful and effective collective action. It's hardly a major life changing decision not to use Amazon, Meta, Google, anything that Musk purveys and so on.  Even cutting down on use is better than nothing at all. Good luck on using the internet and avoiding Amazon Web Services.  ec2-18-205-249-107.compute-1.amazonaws.com is where this page is hosted. Drat! 

Pensions. Very much connected to the above. What's your investing in? If you have a care about ethics and what your money is being invested in, the least you can do is be aware of your schemes stance on meeting environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards.
