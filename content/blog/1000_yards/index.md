   alt="A black and white photograph of two young people (s2, s3) standing outdoors. On the left is a person with shoulder-length dreadlocks wearing an Angry Birds t-shirt that reads AHEAD, MAKE ME ANGRY with cartoon bird characters. On the right is a person with curly hair wearing a Charlie Brown All-Stars t-shirt featuring Peanuts characters. Both are wearing jeans and appear to be standing on a path or open area with trees visible in the background. The image has an artistic, portrait-style composition shot from a low angle looking up at the subjects."
