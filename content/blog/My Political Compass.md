[The Political Compass](https://www.politicalcompass.org). The essence of the site is a model for political analysis. The site has been online since 2001. Developed by a journalist and an academic working on the inadequacies of simple left-right political identities. Check the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5u3UCz0TM5Q) for some background. 

Pleased to find my aggregated responses to the propositions posed indicate I am a lefty libertarian. I like the company I'm in.
