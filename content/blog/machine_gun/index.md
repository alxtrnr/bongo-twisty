Back in July 2010 I made a passing mention in [this post](https://www.bongotwisty.blog/dancing_circles/) that one of my favourite Medway bands [The Singing Loins](https://thesingingloins1.bandcamp.com/music) had asked to use a photo I took of them playing at the local RAFA club for the inside of their next album/CD Stuff.

   title="The Singing Loins"
   alt="Four musicians performing live on stage at what appears to be a music venue. From left to right: a vocalist singing into a microphone while holding a guitar, a bald drummer in the background, a central performer wearing a black hat and jacket singing into a microphone while holding a colorful patchwork instrument or prop, and a guitarist on the right playing an acoustic guitar. The stage has white walls with black draping, a MUSIC sign visible in the background, and various musical equipment including amplifiers and microphones scattered across a patterned carpet floor."

I was pretty chuffed to have the opportunity to give them something for all the free sessions they have played which I have been to in and around the area. Well after a bit of their own editing the picture I took turned into the one you see below and they've been using it pretty extensively all of the place to promote the album. Good on them. Turned out alright I reckon.

   title="Stuff"
   alt="A black and white promotional image showing three musicians performing, presented in a torn paper aesthetic with jagged white borders against a black background. From left to right: a vocalist singing into a microphone, a central performer wearing a black hat and holding what appears to be a washboard or similar percussion instrument, and a guitarist playing an acoustic guitar. A yellow circular badge or sticker in the bottom left contains text that appears to reference The Singing Loins and includes the word stuff prominently displayed."
