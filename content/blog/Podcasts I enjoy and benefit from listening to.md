Happy to share and recommend each of the podcasts below. Have a listen. A worthwhile way to pass a bit a time. 

* [You Are Not So Smart](https://youarenotsosmart.com/podcast/) - The premise being that we are unaware of how unaware we are and have little idea why we act or think the way we do. Despite this, we create narratives to explain our feelings, thoughts, and behaviours. These narratives – no matter how inaccurate – become the story of our life. The podcast explores the ways we tend to develop an undeserved confidence in human perception, motivation, and behaviour. 

* [Clearer Thinking](https://www.clearerthinking.org/podcast) - In-depth conversations exploring useful ideas related to psychology, society, behaviour change, philosophy, science, artificial intelligence, math, economics, self-help, mental health, and technology.

* [Insights at the Edge](https://www.resources.soundstrue.com/podcast/) - Tami Simon, Founder and Publisher of [Sounds True](https://www.soundstrue.com/) interviews spiritual teachers, visionary writers, and living luminaries about their newest work and current challenges—the growing edge of their inner inquiry and outer contribution to the world.

* [Philosphize This](https://www.philosophizethis.org/podcasts) - Dedicated to sharing the ideas that shaped our world. Beginner friendly if listened to in order. An educational podcast about philosophy where you don't need to be a graduate-level philosopher to understand it. In chronological order, the thinkers and ideas that forged the world we live in are broken down and explained.

* [Bike Life](https://www.podpage.com/bike-life/) - from [Warmshowers.org Foundation](https://www.warmshowers.org/node/367640), a community of bicycle tourists and people who support them on the way. Guests and hosts. The Bike Life podcast brings together the stories of both from around the world to share their knowledge and experiences.

So much vying for our time and attention. Using an [mp3](https://www.westerndigital.com/products/mp3-players/sandisk-clip-sport#SDMX24-008G-A46K) player for downloading and listening to episodes when out on my bike works well for me. Long drives, housework and gardening are some other activities that lend the time to have a listen.
