Things are moving on the blog design front. I’m beginning to find my way round the style sheet and make some changes here and there. Read up a bit about CSS in wordpress. I've been having problems with widgetising the side bar messing with the styling of the search box, and that images have borders I can’t get rid of. If anyone can tell me how to over come these two problems that would be great.

I was recently put in charge of an [Olympus OM1 SLR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympus OM-1 "OM1") camera. The OM1 was the first compact SLR manufactured and has a earned itself a good reputation and a place in the hearts of many photographers. With the camera came three lenses. A 50mm, 28mm and a 200mm zoom. The ASA cover was missing and the camera and lenses all needed a service. I got in touch with a local fella who had a small home business fixing up cameras. He gave it all the once over. Replaced a few parts. Got everything back today. It all looks as good as new. The zoom lens is a bit broken. The mechanism to stop the aperture down is missing. You can still adjust the apperture but need to do so and hold it manually. That could result in a few interesting shots!

Took some pictures near to where it was repaired. A rural setting. Lots of blue bells. The camera was great to use with the 28mm lens on it. Hope that some of the pictures come out looking as good as they did through the viewfinder. Took some as well with the digital ([panasonic fz5](http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/panasonicfz5/ "DP Review FZ5 ")) so shall be able to compare the two takes when the film gets developed.
