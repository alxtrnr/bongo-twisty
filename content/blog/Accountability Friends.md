I joined an online accountability group last week. I had a go at sharing a few intentions publicly. I acted on two and ignored the third. Not sure sharing them in a small group helped much. I think I would have done the things I did anyway. 

I like the idea of the group. Accountability friends are few and far between in my life. The group is in its early days. I think checking in regularly is the thing to do this week. 

Looking out for and practising emotional validation, meaningful replies, curiosity, empathy, openness and sharing vulnerability.  I was reminded of (learned) that reading "*Sorry I'm Late, I Didn't Want to Come*" by Jessica Pan. *An Introvertâ€™s Year of Living Dangerously*. It's a great read. Poignant, inspirational and funny. 

Tuesday afternoon check in to keep it real for me...

1. I opened the doc and worked on the review and update for about 90 minutes. Shared the plan to do at least a hour each day with my manager. They was good with that. No deadline set but did suggest sharing my work with colleagues at some point. Smart move. 

2. Bit more done in the alleyway. Car load of sacks taken to the tip this morning. Filled a few more sacks. The alley starts from the green gate. This is is about the third of the way to my garden at the other end of the alley. Still a lot more bags to fill.
