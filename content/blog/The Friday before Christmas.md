Sister came today from Deal. Its about 50 miles away. Its very foggy. Nice to see her. I would have understood a phone call crying out due to poor visibility. Christmas Spirit perhaps.

Had the fire burning. 10 kg of coal and a big sack of logs. What have you contributed to global warming today?

Nipped into town with the boys early evening. They played on the old canons and I perched the Panasonic and snapped this.

Converted from colour and added a little bit of lens blur on the sides. It's turned out just as I wanted.

Dodged the story tonight. I’m here and the washing up is calling me in…
