I've had a [Ride with GPS](https://ridewithgps.com) account for years. The mapping / routing tools are excellent. Each month and once a year an email lands with a link to a graphic recapping my riding stats for the respective period of time. 

Over the years I have saved a few. Collections are good. Recently realised how to generate them for all the years and months I have missed or deleted. If you have an account it's very easy to do. All you need to do is modify the link RWGPS share with you to a monthly recap. For a different month and year just edit the respective fields. For the year card delete the month field and just enter whatever year you're after. 

## How To Generate Missing Cards

- Use a previously shared Ride with GPS recap card link as a template.

- For **different months or years**, just edit the `month` and `year` fields in the URL:
  - Set `month` to the desired number (e.g., `08` for August).
  - Set `year` to the desired four-digit year (e.g., `2023`).
- To create a **yearly card**, remove the `month` field entirely and only specify the year.

## Example Templates

**Monthly card:**  

`https://ridewithgps.com/users/USERID/card.jpg?h=HASHVALUE&lang=en&metric=true&month=08&otu=&year=2025`

Edit `USERID`, `month`, and `year` as needed.

**Yearly card:**  

`https://ridewithgps.com/users/USERID/card.jpg?h=HASHVALUE&lang=en&metric=true&year=2025`

Just remove the `month` parameter for a yearly summary.

Doing this I created a card for every year from 2012. [RWGPS Year Recap](http://localhost:1313/bongo-twisty/gallery/cycling/rwgps_years/). Planning on creating retrospective posts for all the monthly cards. I love a collection.
