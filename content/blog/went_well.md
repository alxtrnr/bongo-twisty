Woke up early. Listened to [Strong Medicine](https://www.iawaketechnologies.com/strong-medicine) for 40 minutes. Rolled over to go back to sleep. Start as you mean to go on came to mind. I jumped out of bed and was out the door with my bike a few minutes before 5.00 am.  That was the hard part done.

I enjoyed the ride. No wind. Good temperature. It was dry. I saw the sun come up. Perfect.

Back home, washed and dressed in time for an 8.00 am remote group meeting. It was worthwhile. First one since June. It got me thinking about a few things close to home.\
That meeting was followed by the regular 9.00 am work catch up on Teams. Zoned out for much of that. 

Had a bit of a break before getting stuck in to what needed doing. Did not stick with it for long. Allowed myself off task for an hour or so. Continued working on a side project. All the time knowing I was on borrowed time. 

Wrapped that up some time before midday. I made it more of an effort to become distracted and focused on the task in hand. 

Next noticed the time at 1.30 pm. Felt pretty pleased with that. Could have stopped for lunch (16:8 IF from 9.00 pm to 1.00 pm). I had the momentum to keep going so went with it until the job was done just before 2.30 pm. 

40 minutes break for lunch then back at it. The days most important things had been done. I had some time to organise my thoughts and the next chunk of work to take on. Made a reasonable start. Called it a day at 4.30 pm but stayed available till just after 5.00 pm. 

Since I'd been out for a ride in the morning I had a bit of time to turn my attention once more to this side project. Progress made. Learning acquired. 

Last nights post worked. I turned things around. It was not difficult. All it took was around four hours of focused, deliberate effort.\
Setting the intention and holding myself to account. I know this works for me. Whenever I do I always feel better for it. Feeling pleased with myself and happy about how the day was spent.
