The [Care Quality Commission (CQC)](https://www.cqc.org.uk) has to date assessed 72 local authorities across 9 quality statements. I wanted to look at how the outcome of Kent County Council's CQC assessment compared nationally with other local authorities. 

The CQC website has several [pages of links](https://www.cqc.org.uk/search/content/7217) to all the local authority assessments completed. Each assessment page has another link to the outcome summary for the respective local authority. I could not find an aggregated table of results to make easy comparisons between them. Clicking link after link to diplay each summary page in a new tab was not going to work. 

I spent a few hours today coding with prompts to Claude Sonnet 4.5 via Perplexity to create the interactive reports linked below:

**[üìä Comprehensive Analysis of All 72 Authorities](/reports/cqc_comprehensive_report_20251003_1541.html)**  
Complete breakdown of ratings for each quality statement, top/bottom performers, and full dataset.

**[üìç Kent-Focused Analysis](/reports/cqc_kent_focused_report_20251003_1547.html)**  
Detailed analysis focusing specifically on Kent County Council's assessment.

**[üèÜ CQC Local Authority Assessment League Tables](/reports/cqc_league_tables.html)**
Interactive rankings across all 9 quality statements with theme-based comparisons and performance heat maps

Each report includes sortable tables and detailed metrics for each authority's performance. It's kind of work related. They display the data in a way that works for me and enable making the comparisons I was after. 

It was close to 100% [vibe coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding). One of many DiY coding projects I have completed this way. Prompt, test, iterate. Job done. Good enough will do.
