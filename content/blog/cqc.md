The [Care Quality Commission (CQC)](https://www.cqc.org.uk) has to date assessed 72 local authorities across 9 quality statements. I wanted to look at how the outcome of Kent County Council's CQC assessment compared nationally with other local authorities. 

The CQC website has several [pages of links](https://www.cqc.org.uk/search/content/7217) to all the local authority assessments completed. Each assessment page has another link to the outcome summary for the respective local authority. I could not find an aggregated table of results to make easy comparisons between them. Clicking link after link to diplay each summary page in a new tab was not going to work. 

I spent a few hours today coding with prompts to Claude Sonnet 4.5 via Perplexity to create the interactive reports linked below:

**[üìä Comprehensive Analysis of All 72 Authorities](/reports/cqc_comprehensive_report_20251003_1541.html)**  
Complete breakdown of ratings for each quality statement, top/bottom performers, and full dataset.

**[üìç Kent-Focused Analysis](/reports/cqc_kent_focused_report_20251003_1547.html)**  
Detailed analysis focusing specifically on Kent County Council's assessment.

**[üèÜ CQC Local Authority Assessment League Tables](/reports/cqc_league_tables.html)**
Interactive rankings across all 9 quality statements with theme-based comparisons and performance heat maps

Each report includes sortable tables and detailed metrics for each authority's performance. It's kind of work related. They display the data in a way that works for me and enable making the comparisons I was after. 

It was close to 100% [vibe coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding). One of many DiY coding projects I have completed this way. Prompt, test, iterate. Job done. Good enough will do. 

The following overview was also generated by Claude Sonnet 4.5 via Perplexity. Make of it what you will. AI slop?

### **üéØ CQC Local Authority Assessment Scripts: Complete Functionality Overview**

A suite of Python scripts to scrape, analyse, and visualize CQC (Care Quality Commission) Local Authority assessment data was created. Here's what each component does:

***

### **üìä Script 1: CQC Data Scraper**

### **Core Functionality:**

This is the main data extraction engine that achieves **100% data extraction success** across all 72 local authorities and 9 quality statements.

### **Key Features:**

#### **1. Web Scraping \& Data Collection**

- **Automated pagination detection**: Identifies total pages dynamically from CQC's search results
- **Dual URL pattern support**: Handles both `/summary` and `/overall-summary` page structures
- **Rate limiting \& retry logic**: Implements exponential backoff (429 errors) and 3-attempt retries
- **Concurrent processing**: Uses ThreadPoolExecutor for parallel authority scraping (2 workers by default)


#### **2. Data Extraction**

- **Overall ratings**: Extracts overall CQC ratings (Outstanding/Good/Requires improvement/Inadequate)
- **9 Quality Statement scores**: Captures all QS ratings with multiple matching strategies:
    - Exact string matching
    - Substring matching
    - Fuzzy matching (75%+ similarity using difflib)
    - Word-based partial matching
- **Score to rating conversion**: Converts numerical scores (1-4) to text ratings
- **Assessment metadata**: Captures assessment dates, URLs, and publication dates


#### **3. Robust Matching System**

The scraper uses **4-tier matching strategy** to ensure 100% extraction:

```python
Strategy 1: Exact match (case-insensitive, normalized)
Strategy 2: Substring match (key in label)
Strategy 3: Fuzzy similarity match (>75% similarity)
Strategy 4: Word-based partial matching (60%+ word overlap)
```


#### **4. Data Output**

Generates three output formats in `cqc_la_results/` directory:

- **CSV files**:
    - `la_detailed_assessments.csv` - Complete dataset with all ratings
