> “What do you love doing so much that the words failure and success essentially become irrelevant?”

This question is one of those placed at the end of [James Clear's 3,2,1 Thursday Newsletter](https://jamesclear.com/3-2-1). 

Cycling. There are goals for sure. [Annual distance](https://www.bongotwisty.blog/stats_cli/). [RRtY](https:https://www.bongotwisty.blog/diy-do-it-yourself-randonneur-around-the-year-rrty/). Completing each single ride I set out on. Late spring tours. They all add a bit of interest and and purpose. Of course I want to complete what I set out to do. If I do that's great. If I don't it that's a shame. Either outcome makes no difference to me still wanting to ride. 

Blogging. I'm not sure how I can succeed or fail with this. I have no measures of success. I keep a blog because I enjoy seeing my stuff on the internet. I enjoy spending time tweaking the appearance and functionality. Adding new content. Looking at past posts and pictures. 

With both there are days, sometimes weeks or months I do not feel like doing one or the other. Sometimes neither. Could be for many reasons but not because of success or failure.

There will be other things I'm sure. Success or failure is not something I often think about. Certainly not to an extent that influences whether I do that thing or not.  Much of what I do for the sake of doing it. Journey not destination. I am quite happy to pick things up and learn as I go along.
