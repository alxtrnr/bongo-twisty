An amazing effort. I met Mark Beaumont back in 2013 near Loch Katrine up in The Trossachs National Park, Scotland. He had just completed a section of the 230 miles from Arran to Aberdeen he was doing by foot and in the water, in only 10 days to raise money for the [STV Appeal’s fight against child poverty in Scotland](http://www.stvplc.tv/blog/2013/05/mark-beaumont-all-set-for-crossscotland-challenge-for-stv-appeal). True to his reputation and as seen in the video above he was affable to the end and did not hesitate in agreeing to have his picture snapped with me.
