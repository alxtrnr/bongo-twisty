Out on my bike yesterday and my Karoo 2 GPS came off my bars. I did not notice until after a few miles had passed. Live tracking showed me where to go find it. It was on a quiet country lane.  I rode back as fast as I could hoping to find it in one piece while imagining the worst. 

I found it in a shallow puddle, looking tragic, face down on the side of the road. The screen was damaged quite badly. Tracking had paused but it was still working. I reattached it and continued the ride back home.

The device is still operational and displays a map interface showing Upper Bush area, with battery at 77%, time reading 2:14:31, and navigation controls visible on the left side. The screen damage is concentrated in the bottom left corner with radiating cracks.](20251024_karoo2.jpg)

I've been using a cheap aftermarket mount to hold the GPS on my handlebars. There are reasons why I had not been using the mount that came with it. All the same it was silly of me to risk using one that was a poor fit and only held the Karoo loosely. My fault entirely. 

The Karoo 2 is the best GPS I have ever owned. Hammerhead have a crash replacement policy for devices still i warranty. Mine one is out of warranty but thought no harm in asking if there was any chance of helping me out with a discount on a new or reconditioned one. Fingers crossed goodwill and discretion will prevail.
