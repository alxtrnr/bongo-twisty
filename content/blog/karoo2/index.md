Out on my bike yesterday and my Karoo 2 GPS came off my bars. I did not notice until after a few miles had passed. Live tracking showed me where to go find it. It was on a quiet country lane.  I rode back as fast as I could hoping to find it in one piece while imagining the worst. 

I found it in a shallow puddle, looking tragic, face down on the side of the road. The screen was damaged quite badly. Tracking had paused but it was still working. I reattached it and continued the [ride](https://ridewithgps.com/trips/345654457) back home.

The route has 902 meters of elevation gain and a moving time of 3 hours 10 minutes. An elevation profile graph below the map shows relatively flat terrain with notable hills near the end of the route.](card.png)

The screen damage is concentrated in the bottom left corner with radiating cracks.](20251024_karoo2.jpg)

I've been using a cheap aftermarket mount to hold the GPS on my handlebars. There are reasons why I had not been using the mount that came with it. All the same it was silly of me to risk using one that was a poor fit and only held the Karoo loosely. My fault entirely. 

The Karoo 2 is the best GPS I have ever owned. Hammerhead have a crash replacement policy for devices still under warranty. Mine one is out of warranty but thought there's no harm in asking if there was a chance of helping me out with a discount on a new or reconditioned one. Fingers crossed goodwill and discretion will prevail.
