Out on the last 200k rde of 2025 yesterday. Followed a route I know well through the Kent Downs to Deal, over to Canterbury before heading across to Tankerton, then Faversham and back home to Chatham. 

With this ride completed thats the Super Randonneur (SR) Award bagged for the 2025-2026 audax season. The SR is a series: 200 km, 300 km, 400 km, 600 km, all completed in the same Randonneur year.

The ride takes me by my two sisters and parents homes on the way so I took the opportunity to deliver Christmas cards and pressies. 

My sister in Deal dosed me up with a big helping of Sloe Gin she'd made. I'd never drunk it before. Didn't think I would like it since I don't enjoy spirits as a general rule of thumb. I did like it though hence the generous measure she poured me. 

I set off again feeling alright, maybe a little bit woozy but steady enough. It took a toll though on my percieved exertion. The 50k or so from Deal to Tankerton took me nearly three hours. Felt like a lot more hard work than it normally does. At the time I put it down to the [Tannus Armour](https://www.tannus.co.uk) tyre inserts I'd fitted to mitigate the risk of punctures. I've had loads of flats over the last month. Hedge trimmings along country lanes, glass shards and flint. While the inserts may have been a contributing factor I think it was the gin that put lead in my legs. At least I did not get any punctures. 

Despite the physical sruggle It was a good ride. The weather was dry. Not too cold. Very little wind. What's more there was loads of festive postbox toppers to snap a picture of and add to the growing [collection](http://localhost:1313/bongo-twisty/gallery/postbox_toppers/)...
