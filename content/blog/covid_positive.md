Excused from all obligations aside from one. To isolate from others for the time being. 

It's 10.30 in the morning. I am isolating in the 'work room' at home. Beddings on the floor. I have my laptop. Music is playing. I have fast internet. Films, books, games and more online learning and distractions I could ever possibly use.

Had a bit of a cough over the weekend. Negative PCR on Saturday. Negative LFT on Monday. Bit of a headache and felt hot on Tuesday. Did another LFT in the evening. Slowly slowly the T line appeared. 

PCR test to follow up the result has been ordered. Can't see getting a result for that till after Christmas. 

My shifts at work will be covered. Should be working long days from today till Christmas Eve then nights from the 27th. Not sure about pay. Think there is a discretionary element to it. Not sure. Not too worried. Presents are bought. Collected the Christmas food order yesterday afternoon. I feel fine this morning. Snug as a bug. Smug with a bug!

Much can be said one way or another about the threat response. I have an opinion. It's formed from my own biases and the absence of sound, well rounded scientific understanding. Not worth sharing. It seems better to do that which helps those around me feel reassured. I shall isolate and test in the relative comfort of my surrounds and enjoy whatever time off I have.
