Week notes. I'm finding the process a bit unsatisfactory. Everyday things come to mind that a brief note would be useful to help process and develop further. Everyday there's an interaction that gets me thinking. Everyday there's some sensory experience that feels notable. Everyday an action/omission. Everyday an experience to ponder on. You get the idea. 

I don't make brief notes during each day. Thoughts and experiences just come and go. 

Looking back on all that has happened once a week misses so much out. It's not that I lead an especially interesting, unusual or or action packed life. Life just happens. It's non stop. 

I'm quite methodical by default. Sitting down to write week notes feel's like a chore. If I miss stuff out it does not feel like I have done an honest job. The story is not even half told. Editing is not my bag either. I've not found a happy medium between it being a box ticking exercise and a rambling narrative. 

The best analogy I can think of right now is flavour. I just don't like the taste of week notes. It feels false, manufactured and a bit performative. A poor one at that. Week notes is turning out to be a "task", one I struggle with and do not look forward to. I'm going to take a break from it for now.
