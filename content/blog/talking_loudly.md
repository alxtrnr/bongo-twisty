Another question picked at random from the archives of the [3,2,1 Thursday Newsletter](https://jamesclear.com/3-2-1) by James Clear 

> If your partner or close friend could change one habit of yours, what would they choose â€” and why might they be right?

I had no idea so I asked. 

"Talking loudly."

What! Talking loudly? Me? What choo talkin' about! That's not even a habit! 

Not really. That would not have gone down well. It was a surprise though. Spouse said she's told me before. I suppose not listening might come a close second. I didn't ask.  

"If you've got something to say you're gonna' make sure you're heard". 

Err... yes. Why wouldn't I? When I speak I want to be heard.

Spouse spoke about people conflating talking loudly with conveying confidence. Correlation and causation came to my mind. 

Why might be spouse right? I'm going for subjectivity. Personality. Personal preference. Maybe this is not a right or wrong thing. Maybe this is more about understanding and taking into account. 

Context, empathy, and adaptation. All add to the mix for a resilient and rewarding relationship.
