We went out on Wednesday to see [Ben Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Jones_(musician)) and [Scott Brunger](https://www.youtube.com/@bucklandhill) play at The Barge in Gillingham. It was a very good night. Ben was his usual amicable and very talented self. He played a particular blinder using a magical sampling box to layer his voice and instrumentation to build up a musical arrangement of [Ivor Cutler's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivor_Cutler "Wikipedia - Ivor Cutler") song "[Women of the World](http://archive.wfmu.org:5555/archive/BL/BL_Cutler,_Ivor_and_Linda_Hirst_-_Women_Of_The_World.mp3)". Fantastic stuff.
