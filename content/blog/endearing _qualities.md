> What's something someone can do the first time you meet them that makes you find them much more appealing?

Cheerful and upbeat. A positive intonation. Smiles. Laughter. Enthusiasm and interest. Listening and responding. It brings out the best in me. When I'm like that people seem more interesting and appealing to me too.
