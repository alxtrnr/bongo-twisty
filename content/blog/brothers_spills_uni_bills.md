We're on holiday. [Duinrell](https://www.duinrell.com) in Wassenaar, Zuid Holland. A holiday park, amusement park, and water park. It's half way between Den Haag and Leiden. This is our fourth or fifth stay. Three of our four the boys love it here. The oldest has never been a fan of the rides or of swimming. He has stayed at home the last few times we've been. 

Spent the late morning / early afternoon in the amusement park egging each other on to try out every ride. Time at the water park from 8.00 till 10.00 pm. Every slide and the lazy river ticked off. Forwards, backwards, spinning round, faster, faster faster... whoosh!

When I say boys, they're 24, 23, 20 and 16. The youngest asked in February if we could stay here, '...one last time'. The two older brothers were more than happy to come along with him. A friend say to me last week the best thing I have given each of my boys was three brothers. He was right.

Lounging about in between time and s3 mentions in passing he needs £500 deposit and £250 advance rent for his uni accommodation. To be paid by midnight tonight. 

"Thanks for the notice. So what happened to the deposit we paid last year".

"Dunno. The kettle blew up and someone broke a window". 

Pricey communal kettle. Paying for a window he did not break. Sounded a bit light on details to me. "Tell you what. I'll transfer the money when you find out what happened to last years deposit".

He made the call. Turned out the uni was holding onto the money and had omitted to let him know. They said it could not be used for this years deposit. They said it needed to be paid back into his account but that would take a few days. They still needed to be paid today. Of course they do. 

I can't help wondering what would have happened to the money they had of ours had he not asked about it.
