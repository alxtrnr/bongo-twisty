**Work**
I started the week knowing there was a lot to get done by Friday. Monday went well. I submitted two completed projects I'd been working on for a little while. They'd been reviewed and just needed a a few final tweaks to past muster. Attended a meeting that set the direction for the rest of the week. The meeting was cancelled by higher ups just as it started. A few of use were there already. We had things to discuss so went ahead anyway. It was a very productive conversation without them. Had useful conversations with a couple of colleagues. One was prompted by me wanting to apologise about what I thought had been a defensive response to feedback, which I'd asked for and they had given. My colleague was very gracious in saying they did not find my response defensive at all. That created space to go over the subject matter and pull out learning points for both of us. The other meeting was on Thursday. I'd spent most of the week working on a document the need for which was established in the Monday meeting. We reviewed it together. Their input was invaluable. Really worthwhile. Round up on Friday so that things are where they need to be for Monday. 

Not all work weeks are like this. To be honest this was a rare streak of focused productivity. Things that helped included a good balance between what had been done already and what was needed for the final push, fairly high expectations, a realistic challenge and a non negotiable deadline. I was up for it and took ownership of what needed to be done.

We were out to a session on Saturday. Down in Hastings. The Mighty Aba Shanti I meets Humble Rumble. It was in a sports hall. Both sounds had two stacks of well tuned speakers. Good vibes. There was a friendly crowd of people.

Blaugust. A month long festival of blogging. Posted about it [here](https://www.bongotwisty.blog/blaugust/). As with lots of things, I have approached the first week in a way I will not sustain. No need to curb my enthusiasm. That will wane all on it's own. For now Blaugust serves as a vehicle to help learn more about using Hugo, to practice writing again, add to my digital scrap book, and to be inspired from the sites I visit and posts I read. Top of my list this week has been Jedda's [site](https://notes.jeddacp.com). I love the way Jedda organises content. I like the asthetic of her site. The different way Jedda has approached the traditional blog roll and instead maintains a [postroll](https://notes.jeddacp.com/postroll/) appeals to me. I may get round to creating a postroll like it.
