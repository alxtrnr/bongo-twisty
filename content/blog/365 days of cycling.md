The close of another years cycling. Ticked off the three goals I set for myself back in January. Ride every day, ride at least 10,000 miles and earn the Audax UK Super Randonneur Award. As you might imagine I am feeling pretty good about all of this.

We all go about things in different ways. I don't think that many people want to ride every day. Lots of people like the idea of being a cyclist though. Probably not so many keep up the habit. These are the five top things that helped me keep up the habit this year -

1. Sort your clothes out. When you're looking for socks you're not riding.

2. Have one or two go to rides and get very familiar with them. Everything else is gravy.

3. When you're on your bike and moving that means you're cycling. Some days you won't ride far. Some days you'll be slow. Be okay with that. Some days you won't feel like riding at all. Go anyway. You'll regret the missed days more than you will the hard rides.

4. Establish a basic routine and stick with it. You will have to adapt it some days but get back into it as soon as you can. Work on not missing more than two days in a row from your routine. Beg, borrow or ~~steal~~ a bike if you have to.

5. Do not depend on anyone being interested in what you get up to on a bike to motivate you. If you have a family be sure to pay them attention when you're not riding. You're gonna' have to earn those day passes.
