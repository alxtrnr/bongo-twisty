Out on my bike this morning. The back tyre punctured about 12 miles in. I got that sorted okay. 

Before setting off again I went to get the Karoo from my jersey pocket. I'd taken it off the bike to avoid scraping it on the ground when I flipped the bike to remove the wheel. 

I must have missed the jersey pocket and instead put it between the jersey and the hi-vis reflective gilet I was wearing. As I went to retrieve it, fumbling about with my gloves on created a gap between the two tops and the Karoo fell to the floor. 

Less than a month old and I've cracked the screen. Gutted. It's literally just a month since I [cracked the screen on the old one](https://www.bongotwisty.blog/karoo2/).

You can get third party replacement screens for about £100. Knowing me and not wanting to risk damaging internal parts I'm opting for the Hammerhead Crash Replacement. I got a 30% discount on this one with Karoos upgrade program. I think they offer up to a 50% discount on a certified new one when you send a damaged unit back that's still under warranty. 

When I get that I shall fit a [screen protector](https://jm-graphics.com/product/riskless-ultimate-hammerhead-karoo-3-2024/), a [silicon bumper case](https://www.ebay.co.uk/str/tuffluvcases?_trksid=p4429486.m145687.l149086), and be very careful not to drop it again.
