The race passed through Medway at the weekend. It stopped raining and sun shined. Lots of people turned out onto the streets to watch the publicity carnival and then the cyclists race through after them. Really good atmosphere.

I found a good spot to take some pictures at the top of Star Hill in Rochester. I got got the new camera during the week. Having a great time learning how to use it. The picture above is one of many I took with it on the day. Sent it off on Sunday to the Medway Messenger with a few others I got. They published this one and another in today's paper. Think there is a chance they might also publish a few more in Fridays souvenir edition.
