Went to see The Beat last night. They were the first band I ever saw playing live. Then it was in Keynes College at the university of Kent in Canterbury. This time it was at the Beaconcourt Tavern in Gillingham.

I was about 14 or 15 years old then. Loved it. I came home with one of Everett Morton's drum sticks. Thrown into the crowd after having played Mirror In The Bathroom. I still have it.

The journey back was was unreal. Much more than I expected. It took me by surprise. Rudeboy revival!
