![A festive knitted Christmas scene displayed on top of a red Royal Mail post box in a residential street. The handcrafted topper features a winter wonderland tableau on a circular white crocheted base with red detail stitching. At the center stands a tall green spiral Christmas tree decorated with colorful baubles in pink, blue, and other bright colors, topped with a golden yellow star. Surrounding the tree are multiple knitted figures: two white snowmen wearing red Santa hats with white pompoms, one holding a yellow gift, and several small dolls dressed in colorful winter clothing - including figures in red, blue, and green striped outfits with knitted hats. There's also a brown teddy bear character among the group. The scene is photographed outdoors with suburban houses, parked cars, hedges, and a cloudy sky visible in the background, creating a charming community Christmas display.](20251206_christmas_colney_heath.jpg '{"title": "Christmas, Colney Heath", "gallery": "/gallery/postbox_toppers"}')
