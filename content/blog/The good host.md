If this sounds like advice know that pretty much anything that sounds like that is often and may likely be a sounding board for the self. A validity test. Checking out worth and application. A reminder. 

How do you organise your thoughts. They pop into the mind without an invite. Sometimes just a fleeting stay without so much as a goodbye before they vanish again. Other times almost taking up residence and crowding out the place. Do you think you can control your thoughts. Have a go. Test it out now. See how long you can go without thinking... How long did you last? What came to mind. Did you decide to think what you thought. Trying to control your thoughts can be a bit like herding cats. They will do as they please. 

How do you control your emotions. How do you manage your feelings. They too are uninvited guests. Whether greeted with open arms or with distaste they're coming to visit anyway. It's a waste of effort and sometimes counterproductive trying to influence the length of stay. Shutting them away does not help either. Hiding the body does not make it go away.

Try a different approach should you ever feel the need to get a bit of order. Notice those who enter. Welcome them all in. Accept visitors with good grace. Sharing can help marshal the crowd and stragglers. Express yourself. Verbally, in writing, or whatever creative outlet works for you. It can be like like bait. Enticing. Take the lead and dance lest they mill around aimlessly, causing upset and trouble.
