Not so long ago I included in a [post](https://www.bongotwisty.blog/avast_me_hearties/) a comment that I'd like to do a photo assignment of some road construction works.

I wrote to the [Highways Agency](https://nationalhighways.co.uk) asking if there was any chance of having access to construction sites to get some pictures. After a week I had not received any acknowledgement of my request so I wrote again. I [blogged](https://www.bongotwisty.blog/working-long-hours-photographing-road-works-and-getting-a-reply-from-the-highways-agency-any-ideas/) the email I sent and asked if anyone had some tips for this kind of thing.

Well it turns out I did quite well on my own. The Highways Agency had forwarded my email onto their [contractors](http://www.costain.com/home) who got in touch with me today. One of their community relations people has written to say they are willing to escort me round a [major construction project](/pdfs/Exec_summary.pdf) going on just a few miles up the road from my hometown. Still to fix a date but I'm feeling pretty pleased with the development.

I think maybe they are a bit wary I might use the pictures I get to portray roadworks in a bad light i.e. have I any links with road protest organisations and so on. I have not.

Whilst I don't think much of the way North Kent is being concreted over I have no intentions of doing anything with the pictures other than as I described in the email.

Now whether I get any *good light* when the time comes to take the pictures is another matter. Hears hoping for dry weather and interesting skies.
