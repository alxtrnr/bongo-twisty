Promotion. Self or otherwise. I guess self promotion comes first.

What becomes popular is perhaps often as much because of promotion than anything else.

Popularity may be a deceptive measure of quality. Shallow perhaps but also valued and rewarding.

Popularity as the means and the end. Or maybe a byproduct of particular ways of being.

Malleable and transient as much as it is solid and long lasting.

Realising goodness, believing in it, making an continued investment. Easier to see why now.
