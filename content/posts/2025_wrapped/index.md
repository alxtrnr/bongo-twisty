I am very happy to report that I reached the distance goal I set myself for the year - 18,000km done. 

A few things come to mind that have helped. 
- A spouse who knows and accepts that I love riding a bike. I've always been like this. 
- Regularly getting out on my bike at 5.00 am for a 50km ride. Having a goto route when doing so. 
- Living in Kent with easy access to country lanes and rural landscapes. 
- Having a few side goals along the way. 
- [Tracking](https://www.bongotwisty.blog/stats_cli/) my progress. 
- Getting in a two week [bike tour](https://www.bongotwisty.blog/cycle-touring-the-fifteen-signature-discovery-points-of-the-wild-atlantic-way/) in May and a [few](https://ridewithgps.com/trips/347998210) [other](https://www.bongotwisty.blog/meglme/) [long](https://www.bongotwisty.blog/the-giant-circle/) rides during the year. 
- Riding in the dark with dynamo hub powered lights. 
- Dressing for the weather. 
- Living close to a fella who mends my bike when it breaks and not charging the earth to do so. 
- Having a spare bike to ride when I need it.   

This was the state of play on the 20/12/2025. I might get a few more rides in before the year end.

This beats the personal best I achieved of 17,987 km back in 2015. Still cranking out the miles ten years on feels quite reassurring to me. The sense of accomplishment is nothing though compared to the benefit of pursuing the goal. Purpose, motivation, fitness and conditioning, places visited and sights seen. Riding a bike is great. I love it! 

The next 12 months will, fingers crossed, be more of the same. I'm currently three months into two simultaneous [RRtY](https://www.audax.uk/results/rrty-roll-of-honour/) awards. That means at least two rides a month of 200km or more for 12 consecutive months. It's [Audax UK](https://www.audax.uk)'s 50th Anniversary. A good year to go for at least 50 points and get the The Randonneur 5,000 award. The award is obtained by riding [BR or BRM](https://www.audax.uk/about-audax/faqs/#1-accordion-0-body-5) events totalling 5,000 km in a Randonneur year. I've been told that may get me a commemorative fridge magnet. What more of an incentive could I possibly need. 

In May I plan to ride [2,200km through France and Spain down to Portugal](https://ridewithgps.com/events/434073-calais-to-to-montoito-atalaia). I am less worried about getting there than I am about getting my bike in a bag for the journey back by train. I'm sure it will all work out okay with a bit of planning.
