![A collection of hand-crocheted festive mice figurines arranged around a decorated Christmas tree on top of a post box in Upper Higham. The display features seven mice dressed in Victorian-style winter clothing including bonnets, coats, and scarves in earthy tones of brown, orange, green, and grey. One central mouse wears a bright red coat and scarf. The dark blue-green crocheted Christmas tree is adorned with white garland spirals, white pompom ornaments, and a yellow star topper. The scene is photographed just before dawn.](20251213_christmas_upper_higham.jpg '{"title": "Christmas, Upper Higham", "gallery": "/gallery/postbox_toppers"}')
