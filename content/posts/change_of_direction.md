For the last two to three weeks I've been posting quite regularly. It was an exercise in getting things moving. Not especially blogwise but in the world at large. The blog has served as some kind of motivator. It worked.

Reading them through last night it struck me that my posts have gone in a direction I do not wish to pursue. Someone did comment about finding a voice and blogs not being like an online diary. Both of those things began to resonate loudly.

Makes me laugh. Anyone reading these posts might think I'm quite odd. Not to worry. I'm as odd as anyone thinks I am, but I still get by OK.

The intention is to keep momentum but in a different direction.
