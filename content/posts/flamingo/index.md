The title of this post is perhaps a bit misleading. This is not the first post I've written. Rather it's the second post of my latest renascence. You'll have to look at the last post for some type of explanation. Maybe renascence is over egging it a bit but so what I think to myself lets roll with it anyway.

Today started early for me. Not been sleeping well. Been kept awake by dreams. The dreams are down to something I'm not doing so much of these days. I might one day write about what exactly that is. Be good to know if anyone else ever experiences this type of insomnia. It's not as daft as it sounds and dreams really are keeping me from sleeping well. It won't last thankfully. Probably only for another week or so going by past experience.

Anyhow it was a good morning. I have been productive and thorough in my work. The afternoon less so. I've always been better in the mornings. As the day goes by I become more cynical.

I was delighted to find a reply this morning to yesterdays post. I was not expecting one least of all one so soon. Thanks to an online acquaintance called [Brendadada.](https://www.flickr.com/photos/brendadada/)

I've recently entered some pictures to a photography competition. Not so much for the prize which I probably will not be able to take advantage of but more so for my ego. Here's one of the pictures I've submitted -

On another front this post is to carry through on the objective I set myself in the last - to post to the blog every day. To do so has been on my mind intermittently throughout the day. Though it is plainly connected with keeping a blog it's also about doing things differently in spite of myself. So far so good. Roll on tomorrow. I'm not totally surprised to find that it's once I start writing I begin to think of stuff to write about. I'm going to work on writing more with a purpose but for now the purpose is to write hence expect some rambling posts over the coming days and weeks.

I've known for some time now that just being aware of what works for me has little influence on me actually doing what works. Writing this post is though an example of me doing just that. Forward and onward.
