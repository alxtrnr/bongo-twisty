Responding to "[Waiting for... nothing?](https://sly.bearblog.dev/waiting-for-something-to-happen/)" a post on [TOO MUCH TO THINK ABOUT](https://sly.bearblog.dev/). The writer (Sly?) notes that they are,

It's something I have felt in times gone by. It's something I have read and heard other people have also felt. Too small a sample to declare it's common. Maybe it's more so for people whose basic needs are being met. 

Sly asks, 
> "what really matters though?? i'm still waiting to find out." 

My answer is what really matters is whatever you decide matters. I guess you could wait for something to occur to you. If and when that happens and whatever it may be still comes down to a choice you make. No one can tell you what "*really matters*". The best they can do is say what matters to them and what they think should matter to you.  

I say play with the idea. Try things out. Decide to make something really matter to you every day. Soon or later one may persist. Whether persistence matters is another choice you get to make. 

Sly mentions free will. Maybe this answers the question. If free will exists it must sit outside the laws of cause and effect. How's that for a curve ball. Maybe you don't get to decide what really matters at all. If that is the case maybe the question to ask is, why does anything really matter or perhaps, why should it?
