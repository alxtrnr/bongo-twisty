![An autumnal post box topper displayed on a large circular bright orange crocheted platform. The centerpiece features a tower of textured knitted pumpkins in various sizes - pink with blue speckles, olive green, and coral - with decorative stems. Scattered around the base are smaller crocheted elements including miniature pumpkins, brown acorns, colorful mushrooms (red and brown), green oak leaves, and small knitted figures. The display is positioned in front of a blue-painted storefront with large windows, creating a festive seasonal scene](20251122_tankerton.jpg '{"title": "Autumn Harvest, Tankerton", "gallery": "/gallery/postbox_toppers"}')

Always puts a smile on my face when I find one of these. One day I may even learn how to crotchet myself. A fine addition to the growing [collection](https://www.bongotwisty.blog/gallery/postbox_toppers/).
