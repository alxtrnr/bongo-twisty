Last weekend spouse and I went to visit the Houses of Parliament. An audio tour. We saw both chambers; the Lords and the Commons. The tour included a lot of lobbies, Westminster and St Stephens halls, the royal gallery, and robing room. 

It was interesting. I'm pleased we went. The visit reminded me that the power and authority of the place is very much in the history, traditions and institutional rules. Submission and deference to these being a prerequisite for elected Members and Lords. They may portray importance but must all know their place.  

It's a wonder how anything ever changes. Perhaps little has. Elaborate theatrics played out again and again over hundreds of years. The same power structures simply changing hands. The benefactors, and those put upon reliably served and kept in their place respectively.  

The built environment and general atmosphere felt coercive, overbearing and menacing to me. I was pleased to leave when we did. It's not somewhere I felt comfortable being or would want to visit again.
