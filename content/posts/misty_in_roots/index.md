A week ago last Wednesday spouse and I went down to Brighton to see [Misty in Roots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misty_in_Roots) play. Spouse won the tickets in a competition. 

Misty are another band I came across in my teenage years and have enjoyed listening to on and off ever since. One of the great roots reggae bands hailing from the UK who have been around in one form or another since the mid seventies.

Regardless of the line up having changed a good few times in the fifty years they have been performing I am so pleased to have finally taken the opportunity to see them play live now. The distinctive voice of Paco who has remained in the band throughout the years sounded great. They played a great set. Classic tunes - Follow Fashion, Food Clothes and Shelter, Ghetto of the City, Own Them Control Them, and Poor and Needy to name just a few.
