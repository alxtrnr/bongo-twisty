Inspired by [Jedda](https://notes.jeddacp.com/postroll/) here's a rolling list of blogs, blog posts or links I've enjoyed. 

It serves no practical function for me since I can save any such posts in my [feed reader](https://github.com/samuelclay/NewsBlur?tab=readme-ov-file). I'm doing this is to hat tip and give thanks to people who took the time to write and publish what they did. I understand it's considered good form to contribute back in this way to the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org). It's also possible to learn something about a person by what they like to read so there's an element of 'getting to know me' in sharing this. 

It will be a first in first out list (FIFO). When the list get's too long for my liking the links at the bottom will be removed to make way for a newcomers at the top. That may have been an unnecessary explanation of a FIFO list. Being explicit sometimes help. 


1.  [WillCycle](https://www.willcycle.com) by [WilliamNB](https://social.vivaldi.net/@WilliamNB). Not just one post but a whole website dedicated to the type of cycling I tend towards. I always find something here I enjoy reading.  
2.   [The Darkness You Choose, The Darkness that Chooses You](https://prickly.oxhe.art/scarcity/) by Prickly Oxheart. This post prompted me to experiment with fasting. All sorts of good things came from that. The author has not posted anything since October. Their last post about [acceptance](https://prickly.oxhe.art/acceptance/) kind of suggests they won't. 
3.   [Your Life is the Sum Total of 2,000 Mondays](https://www.joanwestenberg.com/your-life-is-the-sum-total-of-2-000-mondays/) by JA Westenberg. I happen to like Mondays. JA Westenberg writes very eloquently and in detail about her chosen subjects - tech, humans, and philosophy.
