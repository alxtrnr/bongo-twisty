From a bike ride in May 2025 between the Signature Discovery Points of Ireland’s Wild Atlantic Way. I didn’t always stay on the official route, instead, I often just followed the shortest, most scenic and bike friendly roads between them. The gallery includes a mix of places - a few well-known spots, alongside quieter corners and views I found along the way.
